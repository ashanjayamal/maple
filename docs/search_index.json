Maple is a Symbolic Computation System or Computer Algebra System which can be used to obtain exact analytical solutions to many mathematical problems, including integrals, systems of equations, differential equations, and problems in linear algebra. It also has the capability of plotting functions in 2D and 3D and displaying animations. Maple can perform calculations in binding speed, but one has to be responsible for making these calculations meaningfully and mathematically correct. 1.2 Using a Maple Worksheet The following figure shows the Maple window with a blank Maple worksheet and this window contains: a menu bar across the top with menus: a tool bar immediately below the menu bar, with button-based short cuts to common operations; a context bar directly below the tool bar, with controls specific to the task being performed; The menu bar, tool bar, and context bar. a window, containing a Maple prompt [&gt;, called a worksheet; a status bar at the bottom, with boxes marked Ready, Time and Memory From the File menu, select the options Save or Save As to save the active Maple classic worksheet. Maple classic worksheets are saved with the extension “.mws”, but in the standard interface, Maple worksheets are saved with the extension “.mw” 1.3 Entering Maple Commands The “ &gt; ” is the command prompt in Maple. That is where you type your commands or statements. Every command in Maple should end with a semicolon(;) or a colon(:). (If you use a semicolon then the result of the command will be displayed. If you use a colon then the result will not be displayed.) If you want to make any comments you can use the text format by clicking on the box T in the tool bar or use the symbol #. Video 1.4 Arithmetic operations Arithmetic operators follow the same precedence rules as in Mathematics, and these are brackets, of, division, multiplication, addition and subtraction (BODMAS). Usual arithmetic operations can perform easily with Maple. [&gt; 312+121; &gt; 125-45; The * key is used for multiplication, / for division and ^ for the power. [&gt; 13*267; [&gt; 565/5; [&gt; 561/5; [&gt; 125-45; 13*267; 12345/5; #Three arithmetic operations [&gt; 2^5; [&gt; 2^(-5); [&gt; 3^40; Remark. Don’t use commas when you type large numbers in Maple. - For example: Compute the product 102,136,543 &amp; 20,077,410 . [&gt; 102136543*20077410; 1.5 Operations Maple adheres to the same order of operations that we use in Mathematics. By inserting parentheses, we can change this order. [&gt; 2+3*4-5*6; [&gt; 2+(3*4-5)*6; [&gt; (2+3)*4-5*6; [&gt; 29/(100-11*3^2); [&gt; (3^4-2^6)/(3^2-2^3); 1.5.1 Exercises Exercise 1.1 Calculate the followings \\(1428 + 456 − 41\\) \\(421 × 240 ÷ 55\\) \\((128 − 691 + 458) × 8\\) \\(2214875(201 × 11 − 55)\\) \\(201 ÷ (2012 − 1)\\) \\(21^{4^{2^3}}\\) Exercise 1.2 Compute \\(3^{400}\\). Find the command to find the length (number of digits) of a number. How many digits are there in the number \\(3^{400}\\) ? Does the above command give correct answer to the fractional numbers? 1.6 Shortcut to retyping One shortcut that we use often in Maple to retype is the % key. This refers to most recently executed result. [&gt; 13*23+1; [&gt; %/5; [&gt; %%/5; [&gt; %%%/5; [&gt; 12540*4; [&gt; %/4; [&gt; %/4; 1.7 Fractions and Decimals By simply entering a fraction Maple automatically reduce it. [&gt; 45/4; [&gt; 148/24; [&gt; 25/15; [&gt; 2/3+3/7; [&gt; 3/2+4/5-1/3; You can do calculations with decimal numbers also. [&gt; 25.361+124.6; [&gt; 2.138*0.013; [&gt; 56.101/0.102; 1.8 Roots [&gt; sqrt(16); [&gt; sqrt(30); [&gt; evalf(sqrt(30)); The evalf command numerically evaluates expressions (or sub-expressions) involving constants (for example, Pi, exp(1)) and mathematical functions (for example, exp, ln, sin). [&gt; 30^(1/2); [&gt; evalf(%); 1.8.1 Exercise Exercise 1.3 Compute the following: \\(11 + \\sqrt{31}\\) \\(\\sqrt[3]{64}\\) \\(\\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{3}}\\) Exercise 1.4 Calculate \\(120^8\\) Divide the answer by \\(10^8\\) Divide the answer in part i. by \\(2048 \\times 8\\) 1.9 Pi Vs pi \\(\\pi\\) is a constant in Mathematics and is recognized by maple and typed as Pi (Note the capitalization of “p” but not “i’). [&gt; Pi; [&gt; evalf(%); [&gt; evalf(2*Pi); If you use pi then evalf command does not return \\(\\pi\\) numerically. [&gt; pi; [&gt; evalf(%); 1.10 Rational Numbers Maple usually leaves fractions in fraction form. However, we can force it to express fractions in decimal form using the evalf command. [&gt; 1/7; [&gt; evalf(1/7); [&gt; 25/35; [&gt; evalf(%); Maple displays 10 decimal places as a default. If this is not enough and for better precision you can specify the exact number of decimal places as a second parameter to the evalf command. Note that the second parameter normally represents the number of non-zero digits in the answer. [&gt; evalf(1/7,100); [&gt; evalf(29/3,5); Here, if you want to calculate the answer for 4 decimal places the command should be evalf(29/3,5) and if you want the answer to be 5 decimal places the command should be evalf(29/3,6). [&gt; evalf(1/15,5); [&gt; evalf(11/19,5); Fractions are also rational numbers because their decimal expansions always have repeating blocks of digits. By looking at the decimal representation of a rational number you can see the repeating cycle. [&gt; evalf(1/35); Here we can not see the repeat cycle. But if we calculate \\(\\frac{1}{35}\\) for more decimal places we can see the repeating cycle. [&gt; evalf(1/35, 100); 1.10.1 Exercises Exercise 1.5 Evaluate the value of π correct up to 5 decimal places. Exercise 1.6 Find the area of a circle with radius 10cms Exercise 1.7 Check whether the followings are rational numbers or not \\(\\frac{1}{49}\\) \\(\\pi\\) \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) Exercise 1.8 How many digits are repeating in \\(\\frac{1}{212}\\) 1.11 Complex Numbers In Maple, complex arithmetic is normally done automatically with I standing for \\(\\sqrt{−1}\\) (for example, if you square I you will get -1, not I^2) [&gt; (-4+7*I)+(5-10*I); [&gt; 5*I-(-9+I); [&gt; (1-5*I)*(-9+2*I); [&gt; (3-I)/(2+7*I); But Maple does not always automatically evaluate an expression involving complex numbers. For example, it may leave an expression as the product of some complex numbers or as an expression involving a root of a complex number. [&gt; (-2*I)^(1/2); The function evalc to force Maple to evaluate as a complex number. [&gt; evalc((-2*I)^(1/2)); Note that evalc does not give you both the square roots of -2*I it only gives the principal value of the root. If you want to find the roots, use solve command as follows. [&gt; solve(z^2=-2*I); 1.11.1 Exercise Exercise 1.9 Simplify the following: \\((−3 + 3i) + (7 – 2i)\\) \\((5 + 3i) − (3 − i)\\) \\((1 + 2i)(1 − 2i) 4. (56 − 8i) ÷ (14 + 10i)\\) Exercise 1.10 Simplify \\((2i)^\\frac{1}{2}\\) by using evalc and solve commands. Exercise 1.11 Multiply the following and obtain the answer in standard form: \\[(2 − \\sqrt{−100})(1 + \\sqrt{−36})\\] 1.12 MAPLE Help Maple contains a complete online help system you can use to find information about specific topic easily and to explore the wide range of commands available. To get the information about commands, which you learn in MAPLE, you can use either one of the following. Topic search function F1 key ? In front of the command "],["basic-algebra.html", "Lesson 2 Basic Algebra 2.1 Variables and Expressions 2.2 Assigning values to variables 2.3 Substituting Values 2.4 Factoring expressions 2.5 Expanding expressions 2.6 Finding the degree and leading coefficient of polynomials 2.7 Simplifying Expressions", " Lesson 2 Basic Algebra 2.1 Variables and Expressions Study how we write the following expressions in Maple. [&gt; 3*x; [&gt; 2+3*x; [&gt; x^2; [&gt; 1/(x-2); 2.1.1 Exercise Exercise 2.1 Generate the following expressions using maple commands. \\((2x + 3)(4x + 5)\\) \\(9x^2 − 4\\) \\(\\frac{2x}{5}+\\frac{y}{5}\\) \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2x+1}}{3+y}\\) 2.2 Assigning values to variables Maple will store things (numbers, expressions, functions,…) in ‘containers’ or ‘variables’. This process is called assignment, and you can assign values to the variables by using := or using the command assign. After assigning a value to a variable it becomes a constant and Maple will remember that value from that point. 2.3 Substituting Values To substitute numbers (or other expressions) in the place of variables in an algebraic expression without permanently changing the values of the variable, we use the command, subs(variable, expression). Try to use help [&gt; ?subs 2.4 Factoring expressions Maple can factorize an integer into primes using the command ifactor. 2.5 Expanding expressions One of the most important things Maple can do is to calculate with expressions as well as numbers and we use the command expand to get the expansion of an expression. 2.6 Finding the degree and leading coefficient of polynomials The highest power of the variable that occurs in the polynomial is called the degree of a polynomial. The leading term is the term with the highest power, and its coefficient is called the leading coefficient. If \\(x\\) is a single indeterminate, the degree and ldegree commands compute the degree and low degree respectively, of the polynomial \\(p\\) in \\(x\\). [&gt; p:=(x+5)^5; [&gt; expand(%); [&gt; degree(p,x); [&gt; ldegree(p,x); The coeff(p, x^n) command finds the coefficient of \\(x^n\\) in the polynomial \\(p\\) where \\(p\\) is the polynomial in \\(x\\) and \\(n\\) is the integer corresponds to the power. When finding the leading coefficient, \\(n\\) corresponds to the highest power in the polynomial.

Use the help command to find the general definition of a matrix. To work with Matrices first load the package linalg Which include most linear algebra related commands. 3.1 Defining matrices There are several ways to define Matrix. Let’s look at them through examples.

[&gt; transpose(A); 3.2 Row Opreations In your linear algebra class you will learn elementary row operations on matrices here we will use Maple to do the same thing. Let’s define a new matrix \\(A\\). addrow(A,r1,r2,m) Returns a copy of a matrix \\(A\\) in which row r2 replaced with by row(A,r2)+m*row(A,r1) [&gt; A:=matrix([[1,4,3,10],[2,1,-1,-1],[3,-1,4,11 [&gt; addrow(A,1,2,-2); [&gt; addrow(%,1,3,-3); mulrow(A,row,expr) Returns a matrix \\(A\\) in which has the same entries as \\(A\\) with the \\(r^{th}\\) row mutiplied by \\(expr\\) [&gt; mulrow(A,2,-1/7); [&gt; mulrow(%,3,-1/3); swaprow(A,r1,r2) This command interchange row r1 and r2 of \\(A\\) [&gt; swaprow(A,2,3); Similarly, you can learn addcol, mulcol,swapcol commands by your self. 3.3 Determinanat of Matrix To find the determinate of a matrix, maple has a special command det.

A solution to a system consists of one or more set of specific values that our common solution to each of the individual equations. Here is a simple example which we can solve quite easily using the solve command. [&gt; sys:={2*x+5*y-4*z=9,3*x+5*y+2*z=12,4*x-y+5*z=-3}; [&gt; solve(sys,{x,y,z}); Output: Maple will automatically use fractions, however you can force decimal answers using the evalf command.

[&gt; A:=genmatrix(sys,[x,y,z],b); [&gt; evalm(b); Output: In this case , \\(A\\) is the coefficient matrix, and \\(b\\) is vector representing the constant values. The command evalm(b) evaluated \\(b\\) as a matrix (a vector is a \\(n \\times 1\\) matrix). In other words, this command simply writes out what the vector \\(b\\) looks like.

The form of these solutions will entail the use of parameters. Let’s look an example using two different methods; solve and linsolve. Example 4.1 \\[ \\begin{array}{ccccccccc} x &amp;-&amp; 2y&amp;+&amp; z &amp;=&amp; &amp;3\\\\ x &amp;+&amp; y &amp;-&amp; 2z&amp;=&amp;-&amp;4\\\\ 2x&amp;-&amp; y &amp;-&amp; z &amp;=&amp;-&amp;1 \\end{array} \\] [&gt; restart; [&gt; with(linalg): [&gt; sys:={x-2*y+z=3,x+y-2*z=-4,2*x-y-z=-1}; [&gt; solve(sys,{x,y,z}); output: [&gt; A:=genmatrix(sys,[x,y,z],b); [&gt; evalm(b); [&gt; linsolve(A,b); output: In both cases, the solution contains a parameter. The solve command express it in terms actual variable used,and the linsolve command use the funny t character to distinguish it from a variable you might have defined yourself. 4.3 Inconsistent System An Inconsistent system has no solution. Maple generally, refers to answer questions which have no answer. Example 4.2 \\[ \\begin{array}{ccccccccc} x &amp;+&amp; y &amp;-&amp; 3z &amp;= 10\\\\ x &amp;+&amp; y &amp;-&amp; z &amp;= 1\\\\ x &amp;+&amp; y &amp;+&amp; z &amp;= 8 \\end{array} \\] Let’s try to solve this system. [&gt; restart; [&gt; with(linalg): [&gt; sys:={x+y-3*z=10,x+y-z=1,x+y+z=8}; [&gt; solve(sys,{x,y,z}); Output: This method does not work. It does not return anything. Let’s try linsolve method. [&gt; A:=genmatrix(sys,[x,y,z],b); [&gt; linsolve(A,b); Output: This method also does not works. [&gt; evalm(inverse(A)&amp;*b); Output: 4.3.0.1 Automatic Reduction [&gt; sys:={3*x+5*y+2*z=12,2*x+5*y-4*z=9,4*x-y+5*z=-3}; [&gt; evalm(b); [&gt; C:=augment(A,b); Output: 4.3.1 Method IV An even faster method is simplifying let maple to do all the work for us. The gausselim command will perform all of the steps of Gaussian eliminations and reduce an augmented matrix to row echelon form. [&gt; sys:={3*x+5*y-2*z=12,2*x+5*y-4*z=9,4*x-y+5*z=-3}; [&gt; A:=genmatrix(sys,[x,y,z],b); [&gt; evalm(b); [&gt; C:=augment(A,b); [&gt; gausselim(C); 4.3.2 Method V The command gaussjord does the same thing. It performs all the steps of Gauss Jordan elimination and reduces and reduces an augmented matrix into reduced row echelon form.

Each boat requires the services of three departments, as listed in the table. The cutting, assembly, and packaging departments have available a maximum of 380, 330, and 120 labor hours per week, respectively. Department One Person Boat Two-Person Boat Four-Person Boat Cutting 0.5 hr 1.0 hr 1.5 hr Assembling 0.6 hr 0.9 hr 1.2 hr Packaging 0.2 hr 0.3 hr 0.5 hr How many boats of each type must be produced each week for the plant to operate at full capacity? How is the production schedule in part A affected if the packaging department is no longer used? How is the production schedule in part A affected if the four-person boat is no longer produced?

Where there are constants, Parameters other variable around, Maple assume that you mean to take the integral as the variable you specify changes, and that all other letters in the expression represent constants. 5.2 Definite Integration [&gt; Int(g(x),x=a..b); [&gt; Int(x^2*exp(x),x=0..2)=int(x^2*exp(x),x=0..2); [&gt; f := x -&gt; x*sin(x); [&gt; int(f(x),x=0..Pi); Some functions can not be integrated analytically, but the definite integrals of such functions still have meaning and MAPLE can determine them.

The intparts command has two arguments: the first is the expression to be anti-differentiated, and the second is the choice for, the piece which is to be differentiated. \\[ \\int u D(v) dx = uv - \\int v D(u) dx \\] Example 5.1 Method of integration by parts to compute \\(\\int x \\cos(x)\\) [&gt; restart; [&gt; with(student): [&gt; p1:= Int(x*cos(x),x); [&gt; p2:= intparts(p1,x); [&gt; p3:= value(p2); [&gt; p1 = p3 + C; [&gt; restart; [&gt; with(student): [&gt; Int(sqrt(x)*ln(x),x)=intparts(Int(sqrt(x)*ln(x),x),ln(x)); [&gt; Int(sqrt(x)*ln(x),x)=value(intparts(Int(sqrt(x)*ln(x),x),ln(x))); 5.4 Substitutions These are done using the changevar command.

First, we need to load the DEtools library: We can find the derivative of a given function by using diff command. - The diff command computes the partial derivative of a given expression with respect to the variables given. - The Diff command returns the unevaluated function. Now consider the following examples. Example 6.1 Find the derivative of \\(y=xe^x\\) with respect to x First define the function in Maple. Then you can find the derivative as follows. 6.1.1 Exercise Exercise 6.1 Find the derivatives of the following functions with respect to \\(x\\). \\(y = \\frac{x^2 + \\tan(x^2)}{5x^3 + 9}\\) \\(y = x^{3}\\sin(\\cos^2(x))\\) \\(y = {(x - 4)^2}{\\ln(x)} + \\sin(xe^x)\\) \\(y = {3x^3}{\\sin^{-1}(x)}\\) \\(y = {\\sec^3(x)\\cos(2x) + cosec^2(x)}\\) \\(y = x\\ln(x) + \\cos(2x)e^{5x}\\) \\(y = \\frac{e^{2x} + e^{-2x}}{e^{2x} - e^{-2x}}\\) 6.2 Higher derivatives Following examples show, how to find higher derivatives of functions. 6.2.1 Method 1 You can find the second derivative by differentiating twice. 6.2.2 Method 2 You can get the same result by using the following command. 6.2.3 Exercise Certainly! Let’s express the given expressions in LaTeX and compute their derivatives: Example 6.2 Let \\(f(x) = x^2 \\sin(kx^3)\\). Compute the 3rd derivative, \\(f_{xxx}\\) of \\(f(x)\\). Evaluate \\(f_{xxx}\\) at \\(x = 1\\) and \\(k = 3\\). Example 6.3 Check whether the following functions satisfy the given equations: If \\(y = {(1 + \\sin(x))^2}\\), then \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} - \\cos(x) = 2\\cos(x)\\sin(x) + \\cos(x)\\). If \\(y = x^2 \\sin(x)\\), then \\(\\frac{8y}{x} - 4\\frac{dy}{dx} + x\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = -(x^2 - 2)\\sin(x)\\). 6.3 Homogenous Equations We can check whether a given first order differential equation is homogeneous or not by using the command odeadvisor after loading DEtools package. 6.4 Solving Differential Equations 6.5 Direction Fields A set of short line segment representing the tangent lines can be constructed for a large number of points. This collection of line segment is known as the direction fields of the differential equations. In Maple you can use the DEplot command, but make sure to load the DEtools package. DEplot(deqns, vars, xrange, options) - deqns - list or set of first order ordinary differential equations, or a single differential equation of any order - vars - dependent variable, or list or set of dependent variables - xrange - range of the independent variable Example 6.4 Let see how to graph the direction fields associated with the equation, \\[y&#39; = y(4 − y), y(0) = 1\\] [&gt; restart; [&gt; with(DEtools): [&gt; ODE3:=diff(y(t),t)=y(t)*(4-y(t)); [&gt; dsolve({ODE3,y(0)=1},y(t)); [&gt; DEplot(ODE3,y(t),t=-1..1,y=-1..5); 6.5.1 Exercise Exercise 6.2 Consider the ODE: \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = y - x^3\\) Find the general solution to the equation. Plot the direction fields corresponding to the equation for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) between -2 and 2. Solve the initial value problems. \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = y - x^3\\), with \\(y(0) = {1}\\) \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = y - x^3\\), with \\(y(0) = \\frac{1}{2}\\) Plot the solution curves and the direction fields in the same graph. Exercise 6.3 Plot the direction fields for the following equations and state the stability: \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = y - 5\\) \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = y(1 - y)\\) \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = y^2(y - 3)\\) \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = y^2 - 5y + 6\\) \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = (y - 3)^2\\) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
