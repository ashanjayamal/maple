Maple is a Symbolic Computation System or Computer Algebra System which can be used to obtain exact analytical solutions to many mathematical problems, including integrals, systems of equations, differential equations, and problems in linear algebra. It also has the capability of plotting functions in 2D and 3D and displaying animations. Maple can perform calculations in binding speed, but one has to be responsible for making these calculations meaningfully and mathematically correct. 1.2 Using a Maple Worksheet The following figure shows the Maple window with a blank Maple worksheet and this window contains: a menu bar across the top with menus: a tool bar immediately below the menu bar, with button-based short cuts to common operations; a context bar directly below the tool bar, with controls specific to the task being performed; The menu bar, tool bar, and context bar. a window, containing a Maple prompt [&gt;, called a worksheet; a status bar at the bottom, with boxes marked Ready, Time and Memory From the File menu, select the options Save or Save As to save the active Maple classic worksheet. Maple classic worksheets are saved with the extension “.mws”, but in the standard interface, Maple worksheets are saved with the extension “.mw” 1.3 Entering Maple Commands The “ &gt; ” is the command prompt in Maple. That is where you type your commands or statements. Every command in Maple should end with a semicolon(;) or a colon(:). (If you use a semicolon then the result of the command will be displayed. If you use a colon then the result will not be displayed.) If you want to make any comments you can use the text format by clicking on the box T in the tool bar or use the symbol #. 1.4 Arithmetic operations Arithmetic operators follow the same precedence rules as in Mathematics, and these are brackets, of, division, multiplication, addition and subtraction (BODMAS). Usual arithmetic operations can perform easily with Maple. [&gt; 312+121; &gt; 125-45; The * key is used for multiplication, / for division and ^ for the power. [&gt; 13*267; [&gt; 565/5; [&gt; 561/5; [&gt; 125-45; 13*267; 12345/5; #Three arithmetic operations [&gt; 2^5; [&gt; 2^(-5); [&gt; 3^40; Remark. Don’t use commas when you type large numbers in Maple. - For example: Compute the product 102,136,543 &amp; 20,077,410 . [&gt; 102136543*20077410; 1.5 Operations Maple adheres to the same order of operations that we use in Mathematics. By inserting parentheses, we can change this order. [&gt; 2+3*4-5*6; [&gt; 2+(3*4-5)*6; [&gt; (2+3)*4-5*6; [&gt; 29/(100-11*3^2); [&gt; (3^4-2^6)/(3^2-2^3); 1.5.1 Exercises Exercise 1.1 Calculate the followings \\(1428 + 456 − 41\\) \\(421 × 240 ÷ 55\\) \\((128 − 691 + 458) × 8\\) \\(2214875(201 × 11 − 55)\\) \\(201 ÷ (2012 − 1)\\) \\(21^{4^{2^3}}\\) Exercise 1.2 Compute \\(3^{400}\\). Find the command to find the length (number of digits) of a number. How many digits are there in the number \\(3^{400}\\) ? Does the above command give correct answer to the fractional numbers? 1.6 Shortcut to retyping One shortcut that we use often in Maple to retype is the % key. This refers to most recently executed result. [&gt; 13*23+1; [&gt; %/5; [&gt; %%/5; [&gt; %%%/5; [&gt; 12540*4; [&gt; %/4; [&gt; %/4; 1.7 Fractions and Decimals By simply entering a fraction Maple automatically reduce it. [&gt; 45/4; [&gt; 148/24; [&gt; 25/15; [&gt; 2/3+3/7; [&gt; 3/2+4/5-1/3; You can do calculations with decimal numbers also. [&gt; 25.361+124.6; [&gt; 2.138*0.013; [&gt; 56.101/0.102; 1.8 Roots [&gt; sqrt(16); [&gt; sqrt(30); [&gt; evalf(sqrt(30)); The evalf command numerically evaluates expressions (or sub-expressions) involving constants (for example, Pi, exp(1)) and mathematical functions (for example, exp, ln, sin). [&gt; 30^(1/2); [&gt; evalf(%); 1.8.1 Exercise Exercise 1.3 Compute the following: \\(11 + \\sqrt{31}\\) \\(\\sqrt[3]{64}\\) \\(\\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{3}}\\) Exercise 1.4 Calculate \\(120^8\\) Divide the answer by \\(10^8\\) Divide the answer in part i. by \\(2048 \\times 8\\) 1.9 Pi Vs pi \\(\\pi\\) is a constant in Mathematics and is recognized by maple and typed as Pi (Note the capitalization of “p” but not “i’). [&gt; Pi; [&gt; evalf(%); [&gt; evalf(2*Pi); If you use pi then evalf command does not return \\(\\pi\\) numerically. [&gt; pi; [&gt; evalf(%); 1.10 Rational Numbers Maple usually leaves fractions in fraction form. However, we can force it to express fractions in decimal form using the evalf command. [&gt; 1/7; [&gt; evalf(1/7); [&gt; 25/35; [&gt; evalf(%); Maple displays 10 decimal places as a default. If this is not enough and for better precision you can specify the exact number of decimal places as a second parameter to the evalf command. Note that the second parameter normally represents the number of non-zero digits in the answer. [&gt; evalf(1/7,100); [&gt; evalf(29/3,5); Here, if you want to calculate the answer for 4 decimal places the command should be evalf(29/3,5) and if you want the answer to be 5 decimal places the command should be evalf(29/3,6). [&gt; evalf(1/15,5); [&gt; evalf(11/19,5); Fractions are also rational numbers because their decimal expansions always have repeating blocks of digits. By looking at the decimal representation of a rational number you can see the repeating cycle. [&gt; evalf(1/35); Here we can not see the repeat cycle. But if we calculate \\(\\frac{1}{35}\\) for more decimal places we can see the repeating cycle. [&gt; evalf(1/35, 100); 1.10.1 Exercises Exercise 1.5 Evaluate the value of π correct up to 5 decimal places. Exercise 1.6 Find the area of a circle with radius 10cms Exercise 1.7 Check whether the followings are rational numbers or not \\(\\frac{1}{49}\\) \\(\\pi\\) \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) Exercise 1.8 How many digits are repeating in \\(\\frac{1}{212}\\) 1.11 Complex Numbers In Maple, complex arithmetic is normally done automatically with I standing for \\(\\sqrt{−1}\\) (for example, if you square I you will get -1, not I^2) [&gt; (-4+7*I)+(5-10*I); [&gt; 5*I-(-9+I); [&gt; (1-5*I)*(-9+2*I); [&gt; (3-I)/(2+7*I); But Maple does not always automatically evaluate an expression involving complex numbers. For example, it may leave an expression as the product of some complex numbers or as an expression involving a root of a complex number. [&gt; (-2*I)^(1/2); The function evalc to force Maple to evaluate as a complex number. [&gt; evalc((-2*I)^(1/2)); Note that evalc does not give you both the square roots of -2*I it only gives the principal value of the root. If you want to find the roots, use solve command as follows. [&gt; solve(z^2=-2*I); 1.11.1 Exercise Exercise 1.9 Simplify the following: \\((−3 + 3i) + (7 – 2i)\\) \\((5 + 3i) − (3 − i)\\) \\((1 + 2i)(1 − 2i) 4. (56 − 8i) ÷ (14 + 10i)\\) Exercise 1.10 Simplify \\((2i)^\\frac{1}{2}\\) by using evalc and solve commands. Exercise 1.11 Multiply the following and obtain the answer in standard form: \\[(2 − \\sqrt{−100})(1 + \\sqrt{−36})\\] 1.12 MAPLE Help Maple contains a complete online help system you can use to find information about specific topic easily and to explore the wide range of commands available. To get the information about commands, which you learn in MAPLE, you can use either one of the following. Topic search function F1 key ? In front of the command "],["basic-algebra.html", "Lesson 2 Basic Algebra 2.1 Variables and Expressions 2.2 Assigning values to variables 2.3 Substituting Values 2.4 Factoring expressions 2.5 Expanding expressions 2.6 Finding the degree and leading coefficient of polynomials 2.7 Simplifying Expressions", " Lesson 2 Basic Algebra 2.1 Variables and Expressions Study how we write the following expressions in Maple.

This process is called assignment, and you can assign values to the variables by using := or using the command assign. After assigning a value to a variable it becomes a constant and Maple will remember that value from that point. Method I [&gt; x:=5; [&gt; x^2; [&gt; 2*x+23; Method II [&gt; assign(y,5); [&gt; y^2; You can also define variables in a descriptive manner. However they must begin with a character and any blank spaces must not be included. Note that maple is case sensitive. [&gt; Age:=21; [&gt; age; [&gt; Age; [&gt; Exam_No:=2012300; [&gt; New Age:=Age+4; # There should not be any blank spaces when giving a name for the variable [&gt; New_Age:=Age+4; If you want to reset the predefined value for variables you have to use following methods. Method I: restart command [&gt; restart; [&gt; Age; Method II : unassign The unassign command unassigns all the unevaluated names given as input. [&gt; x:=5; [&gt; x+20; [&gt; unassign(&#39;x&#39;); [&gt; x+20; 2.3 Substituting Values To substitute numbers (or other expressions) in the place of variables in an algebraic expression without permanently changing the values of the variable, we use the command, subs(variable, expression). Try to use help [&gt; ?subs &gt; x; &gt; subs(x=2,x+5); &gt; subs(x=2,x^2-5*x+4); It is convenient to make substitution by giving name for an expression. &gt; expr:=(2*x+1)/(5-3*x); &gt; subs(x=3,expr); You can even substitute other variables or expressions to a variable in an expression. &gt; subs(x=a,expr); &gt; subs(x=a+1,expr); You can also substitute more than one variable for a expression. [&gt; expr1:=(7*x-3*y)/(x^2-y^2); [&gt; subs({x=3,y=2},expr1); [&gt; subs({x=a-2,y=a+2},expr1); [&gt; expr2:=x^2+2*y^2+z^2; [&gt; subs({x=1,y=2,z=3},expr2); 2.4 Factoring expressions Maple can factorize an integer into primes using the command ifactor. [&gt; ifactor(18); [&gt; ifactor(525); [&gt; ifactor(2^8-1); 2.5 Expanding expressions One of the most important things Maple can do is to calculate with expressions as well as numbers and we use the command expand to get the expansion of an expression. 2.6 Finding the degree and leading coefficient of polynomials The highest power of the variable that occurs in the polynomial is called the degree of a polynomial. The leading term is the term with the highest power, and its coefficient is called the leading coefficient. If \\(x\\) is a single indeterminate, the degree and ldegree commands compute the degree and low degree respectively, of the polynomial \\(p\\) in \\(x\\). [&gt; p:=(x+5)^5; [&gt; expand(%); [&gt; degree(p,x); [&gt; ldegree(p,x); The coeff(p, x^n) command finds the coefficient of \\(x^n\\) in the polynomial \\(p\\) where \\(p\\) is the polynomial in \\(x\\) and \\(n\\) is the integer corresponds to the power. When finding the leading coefficient, \\(n\\) corresponds to the highest power in the polynomial. [&gt; coeff(p,x^5); [&gt; coeff(p,x,5); #Another way of finding leading coefficient 2.6.1 Exercise Exercise 2.2 Generate the expression \\(x^3 + \\sqrt{x}\\) using maple commands and find the value of the expression when \\(x = 4\\). Exercise 2.3 \\(PQR\\) is an isosceles triangle where \\( =  = 2 + 3\\) and \\( =  + 3\\). Find an expression for the perimeter of the \\(\\) triangle in terms of \\(\\), giving your answer in its simplest form and find the perimeter when \\( = 8\\).

First, we need to load the DEtools library: We can find the derivative of a given function by using diff command. - The diff command computes the partial derivative of a given expression with respect to the variables given. - The Diff command returns the unevaluated function. Now consider the following examples. Example 7.1 Find the derivative of \\(y=xe^x\\) with respect to \\(x\\). [&gt; with(DEtools): [&gt; y:=x-&gt;x*exp(-x); [&gt; Diff(y(x),x); [&gt; diff(y(x),x); [&gt; Diff(y(x),x)=diff(y(x),x); Example 7.2 Consider the follwing function \\(h\\) of two varibels. \\[h(x,y)=5x^2 + 2x^2y + 3xy^2 + 12yx + \\frac{3y^3}{x}\\] Now we are going to differentiate \\(h\\) partially. The next few commands have been done in order to understand the process. First, we define the function \\(h\\). [&gt; h :=(x,y)-&gt; 5*x^2+2*x^2*y+3*x*y^2+12*y*x+3*y^3/x; Then, [&gt; Diff( h(x,y),x); [&gt; diff( h(x,y),x); [&gt; Diff( h(x,y),x)=diff( h(x,y),x); [&gt; Diff(h(x,y),y); [&gt; diff(h(x,y),y); [&gt; Diff(h(x,y),y)=diff(h(x,y),y); Here we are going to differentiate the function \\(h\\) with respect to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), using them both in one command. Here the function \\(h\\) should be differentiate first with respect to \\(x\\), and then again with respect to \\(y\\). [&gt; diff( h(x,y),x,y); Now, the function h should be differentiate first with respect to \\(y\\), and then again with respect to \\(x\\). [&gt; diff( h(x,y),y,x); First define the function in Maple. Then you can find the derivative as follows. Example 7.3 Define the differential equation \\(y&#39; =y(4-y\\) [&gt; diff(y(t),t) = y(t)*(4-y(t)); We cannot drop the ‘\\((t)\\)’ from the dependent variable \\(y\\). Maple treats ‘\\(y\\)’ and ‘\\(y(t)\\)’ differently, and our equation is for \\(y(t)\\) 7.1.1 Exercise Exercise 7.1 Find the derivatives of the following functions with respect to \\(x\\). \\(y = \\frac{x^2 + \\tan(x^2)}{5x^3 + 9}\\) \\(y = x^{3}\\sin(\\cos^2(x))\\) \\(y = {(x - 4)^2}{\\ln(x)} + \\sin(xe^x)\\) \\(y = {3x^3}{\\sin^{-1}(x)}\\) \\(y = {\\sec^3(x)\\cos(2x) + cosec^2(x)}\\) \\(y = x\\ln(x) + \\cos(2x)e^{5x}\\) \\(y = \\frac{e^{2x} + e^{-2x}}{e^{2x} - e^{-2x}}\\) 7.2 Higher derivatives Following examples show, how to find higher derivatives of functions. ### Method 1 You can find the second derivative by differentiating twice. [&gt; restart; [&gt; y:=x-&gt;x*exp(-x); [&gt; Diff(y(x),x,x); [&gt; d1:=diff(y(x),x); [&gt; d2:=diff(d1,x); 7.2.1 Method 2 You can get the same result by using the following command. [&gt; d1_2:=diff(y(x),x$2); Also you can find higher derivatives by changing \\(n\\). x$n As an example the fifth derivative of the above function as follows. [&gt; d1_5:=diff(y(x),x$5); ### Exercise Certainly! Let’s express the given expressions in LaTeX and compute their derivatives: Example 7.4 Let \\(f(x) = x^2 \\sin(kx^3)\\). Compute the 3rd derivative, \\(f_{xxx}\\) of \\(f(x)\\). Evaluate \\(f_{xxx}\\) at \\(x = 1\\) and \\(k = 3\\). Example 7.5 Check whether the following functions satisfy the given equations: If \\(y = {(1 + \\sin(x))^2}\\), then \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} - \\cos(x) = 2\\cos(x)\\sin(x) + \\cos(x)\\). If \\(y = x^2 \\sin(x)\\), then \\(\\frac{8y}{x} - 4\\frac{dy}{dx} + x\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = -(x^2 - 2)\\sin(x)\\). 7.3 Homogenous Equations We can check whether a given first order differential equation is homogeneous or not by using the command odeadvisor after loading DEtools package. Example 7.6 \\[\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{y^2+2xy}{x^2}\\] [&gt; restart; [&gt; with(DEtools): [&gt; Eq:=diff(y(x),x)=(y(x)^2+2*x*y(x))/x^2; [&gt; odeadvisor(Eq); ::: {.example #unnamed-chunk-31} \\[\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{xy}{x^2+y^2}\\] ::: [&gt; Eq2:=diff(y(x),x)=(x*y(x))/(x^2+y(x)^2); [&gt; odeadvisor(Eq2); 7.4 Solving Differential Equations The command dsolve is used to solve an ordinary differential equation. Example 7.7 Solve the differential equation, \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = -2xy\\) [&gt; restart; [&gt; with(DEtools): [&gt; ODE1:=diff(y(x),x)=-2*x*y(x); [&gt; dsolve(ODE1,y(x)); Maple returned the general solution. _C1 denotes, of course, an arbitrary constant. Maple can handle initial value problems also. suppose we have the initial condition \\(y(0)=2\\). [&gt; dsolve({ODE1,y(0)=2},y(x)); Example 7.8 Example 2: Solve the initial value problem, \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = 8x^3y^2, \\quad y(0) = \\frac{1}{2}\\) [&gt; dsolve( {diff(y(x), x) = 8*x^3*y(x)^2,y(0)=1/2},y(x)); Example 7.9 Solve the initial value problem, \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} + \\frac{y}{x} = 1, \\quad y(1) = -1\\) [&gt; restart; [&gt; with(DEtools): [&gt; ODE2:=diff(y(x), x)+y(x) / x =1 ; [&gt; dsolve({ODE2,y(1)=-1},y(x)); Example 7.10 Solve the initial value problem, \\(y&#39; = y(4 - y), \\quad y(0) = 1\\) [&gt; ODE3:=diff(y(t),t)=y(t)*(4-y(t)); [&gt; sol:=dsolve({ODE3,y(0)=1},y(t)); How do we plot this solution? [&gt; rhsSol:=rhs(sol); [&gt; plot(rhsSol,t=-1..1); 7.5 Direction Fields A set of short line segment representing the tangent lines can be constructed for a large number of points. This collection of line segment is known as the direction fields of the differential equations. In Maple you can use the DEplot command, but make sure to load the DEtools package. DEplot(deqns, vars, xrange, options) deqns - list or set of first order ordinary differential equations, or a single differential equation of any order vars - dependent variable, or list or set of dependent variables xrange - range of the independent variable Example 7.11 Let see how to graph the direction fields associated with the equation, \\[y&#39; = y(4 − y), y(0) = 1\\] [&gt; restart; [&gt; with(DEtools): [&gt; ODE3:=diff(y(t),t)=y(t)*(4-y(t)); [&gt; dsolve({ODE3,y(0)=1},y(t)); [&gt; DEplot(ODE3,y(t),t=-1..1,y=-1..5); Let’s add a solution curve to this plot. To do this, we must specify an initial condition. Let’s try \\(y(0)=1\\). To specify initial conditions in DEplot, you put them in a list, contained in square brackets, [&gt; DEplot(ODE3,y(t),t=-1..1,[[y(0)=1]],y=-1..5,linecolor=blue); You can try out with several initial values as follows: [&gt; DEplot(ODE3,y(t),t=-1..1,[[y(0)=1],[y(0)=0],[y(0)=1],[y(0)=5]],y=- 1..5,linecolor=[blue,green,black,brown]); Observe how the arrows drawn in the direction field are tangent to the solution curves.

To work with Matrices first load the package linalg Which include most linear algebra related commands. 10.1 Defining matrices There are several ways to define Matrix. Let’s look at them through examples. You can use maple help. &gt; ? matrix &gt; restart; &gt; with(linalg): &gt; M1 :=matrix (3, 3, [1,-2,-3,2,-2,2,3,-3,3]); &gt; M2:= matrix(3,4,[1,1/2,-1/3,1/4,2,1/2,-3/4,5/4,3,3/5,3/7,3/8]); [&gt; A:= matrix(3,3,[[1,-3,-2],[2,-3,5],[-4,2,6]]); [&gt; B:=matrix([[1,-3,-2],[2,-3,5],[-4,2,6]]); [&gt; Matrix (2,2,fill=a); [&gt; Matrix (2,2,symbol=a); [&gt; f:=i-&gt;x*i-1; [&gt; M:=Matrix(2,f); [&gt; g:=(i,j)-&gt;x*(i+j—l); [&gt; M1:=Matrix(3,g); To define a diagonal matrix.

A solution to a system consists of one or more sets of specific values that our common solutions to each of the individual equations. Here is a simple example which we can solve quite easily using the solve command. 11.1 Augment of a matrix [&gt; with(linalg): [&gt; A:=matrix([[1,2],[2,3]]); Output: [&gt; B:=matrix([[3,4,5],[6,7,8]]); Output: augment(A,B); Output: The function augment joins two or more matrices together horizontally. The matrices and vectors must have the same number of rows. 11.2 Solving Linear Systems There are three types of systems of linear equations, and three types of solutions. An independent system has exactly one solution. An inconsistent system has no solution. A dependent system has infinitely many solutions. — Type of Linear System Independent Systems Inconsistent Systems No of Solution Exactly one solution No solution Infinitely many solutions Example 1 \\[\\begin{aligned}x - 3y &amp;=-3\\\\2x + y &amp;= 8\\end{aligned}\\] \\[\\begin{aligned}x - 3y &amp;= - 3\\\\x -y &amp;=3\\end{aligned}\\] \\[\\begin{aligned}x - 3y &amp;= - 3\\\\2x + 6y &amp;= -6 \\end{aligned}\\] Example 2 \\[\\begin{aligned}x+y+z&amp;=2\\\\ 6x-4y+5z&amp;=1\\\\ 5x+2y+2z&amp;=3\\end{aligned}\\] \\[\\begin{aligned}x-3y+z&amp;=4\\\\-y-4z&amp;=7\\\\2y+8z&amp;=24 \\end{aligned}\\] \\[\\begin{aligned}2x+y-3z&amp;=0\\\\ 4x+2y-6z&amp;=0\\\\ x-y+z&amp;=0\\end{aligned}\\] Let’s try to solve linear system. Independent Systems: \\[ \\begin{array}{ccccccc} 2x &amp;+&amp; 5y &amp;-&amp; 4z &amp;=&amp; 9 \\\\ 3x &amp;+&amp; 5y &amp;+&amp; 2z &amp;=&amp; 12 \\\\ 4x &amp;-&amp; y &amp;+&amp; 5z &amp;=&amp; -3 \\end{array} \\] \\[ \\underbrace{\\begin{bmatrix} 2 &amp; 5 &amp; -4 \\\\ 3 &amp; 5 &amp; 2 \\\\ 4 &amp; -1 &amp; 5 \\end{bmatrix}}_A \\underbrace{\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y\\\\z \\end{bmatrix}}_X = \\underbrace{\\begin{bmatrix} 9\\\\12\\\\-3 \\end{bmatrix}}_B \\] 11.2.1 Method I A linear system is a collection of first degree equations. A solution to a system consists of one or more set of specific values that our common solution to each of the individual equations. Here is a simple example which we can solve quite easily using the solve command. [&gt; sys:={2*x+5*y-4*z=9,3*x+5*y+2*z=12,4*x-y+5*z=-3}; [&gt; solve(sys,{x,y,z}); Output: Maple will automatically use fractions, however you can force decimal answers using the evalf command. [&gt; evalf(%); Output: 11.2.2 Method II We can also convert the above system of equations to a matrix system. [&gt; A:=genmatrix(sys,[x,y,z],b); [&gt; evalm(b); Output: In this case , \\(A\\) is the coefficient matrix, and \\(b\\) is vector representing the constant values. The command evalm(b) evaluated \\(b\\) as a matrix (a vector is a \\(n \\times 1\\) matrix). In other words, this command simply writes out what the vector \\(b\\) looks like. [&gt; linsolve(A,b); Output: 11.2.3 Method III Another way to solve a matrix equation \\(Ax = b\\) is to left multiply both sides by the inverse matrix \\(A^{-1}\\), if it exists, to get the solution \\(x = A^{-1}b\\). [&gt; inverse(A); [&gt; evalm(inverse(A)&amp;*b); Output: The evalm command forces a matrix computation and express the result. Dependent Systems: Some systems are dependent which means there are an infinite number of solutions. The form of these solutions will entail the use of parameters. Let’s look an example using two different methods; solve and linsolve. Example 11.1 \\[ \\begin{array}{ccccccccc} x &amp;-&amp; 2y&amp;+&amp; z &amp;=&amp; &amp;3\\\\ x &amp;+&amp; y &amp;-&amp; 2z&amp;=&amp;-&amp;4\\\\ 2x&amp;-&amp; y &amp;-&amp; z &amp;=&amp;-&amp;1 \\end{array} \\] [&gt; restart; [&gt; with(linalg): [&gt; sys:={x-2*y+z=3,x+y-2*z=-4,2*x-y-z=-1}; [&gt; solve(sys,{x,y,z}); output: [&gt; A:=genmatrix(sys,[x,y,z],b); [&gt; evalm(b); [&gt; linsolve(A,b); output: In both cases, the solution contains a parameter. The solve command express it in terms actual variable used,and the linsolve command use the funny t character to distinguish it from a variable you might have defined yourself. Inconsistent System An Inconsistent system has no solution. Maple generally, refers to answer questions which have no answer. Example 11.2 \\[ \\begin{array}{ccccccccc} x &amp;+&amp; y &amp;-&amp; 3z &amp;= 10\\\\ x &amp;+&amp; y &amp;-&amp; z &amp;= 1\\\\ x &amp;+&amp; y &amp;+&amp; z &amp;= 8 \\end{array} \\] Let’s try to solve this system. [&gt; restart; [&gt; with(linalg): [&gt; sys:={x+y-3*z=10,x+y-z=1,x+y+z=8}; [&gt; solve(sys,{x,y,z}); Output: This method does not work. It does not return anything. Let’s try linsolve method. [&gt; A:=genmatrix(sys,[x,y,z],b); [&gt; linsolve(A,b); Output: This method also does not works. [&gt; evalm(inverse(A)&amp;*b); Output: 11.2.3.1 Automatic Reduction [&gt; sys:={3*x+5*y+2*z=12,2*x+5*y-4*z=9,4*x-y+5*z=-3}; [&gt; evalm(b); [&gt; C:=augment(A,b); Output: 11.2.4 Method IV An even faster method is simplifying let maple to do all the work for us. The gausselim command will perform all of the steps of Gaussian eliminations and reduce an augmented matrix to row echelon form. [&gt; sys:={3*x+5*y-2*z=12,2*x+5*y-4*z=9,4*x-y+5*z=-3}; [&gt; A:=genmatrix(sys,[x,y,z],b); [&gt; evalm(b); [&gt; C:=augment(A,b); [&gt; gausselim(C); 11.2.5 Method V The command gaussjord does the same thing. It performs all the steps of Gauss Jordan elimination and reduces and reduces an augmented matrix into reduced row echelon form. [&gt; gaussjord(C); 11.3 Exercise Exercise 11.1 Solve the following system of equations. \\[ \\begin{array}{ccccccc} x_1 &amp;+&amp; 2x_2 &amp;+&amp; 3x_3 &amp;= 9 \\\\ 2x_1 &amp;-&amp; x_2 &amp;+&amp; x_3 &amp;= 8 \\\\ 3x_1 &amp; &amp; &amp;-&amp; x_3&amp;= 3 \\end{array} \\] Exercise 11.2 A small manufacturing plant makes three types of inflatable boats: one-person, two-person, and four-person models. Each boat requires the services of three departments, as listed in the table. The cutting, assembly, and packaging departments have available a maximum of 380, 330, and 120 labor hours per week, respectively.

It also has the capability of plotting functions in 2D and 3D and displaying animations. Maple can perform calculations in binding speed, but one has to be responsible for making these calculations meaningfully and mathematically correct. 14.2 Using a Maple Worksheet The following figure shows the Maple window with a blank Maple worksheet and this window contains: a menu bar across the top with menus: a tool bar immediately below the menu bar, with button-based short cuts to common operations; a context bar directly below the tool bar, with controls specific to the task being performed; The menu bar, tool bar, and context bar. a window, containing a Maple prompt [&gt;, called a worksheet; a status bar at the bottom, with boxes marked Ready, Time and Memory From the File menu, select the options Save or Save As to save the active Maple classic worksheet. Maple classic worksheets are saved with the extension “.mws”, but in the standard interface, Maple worksheets are saved with the extension “.mw” 14.3 Entering Maple Commands The “ &gt; ” is the command prompt in Maple. That is where you type your commands or statements. Every command in Maple should end with a semicolon(;) or a colon(:). (If you use a semicolon then the result of the command will be displayed. If you use a colon then the result will not be displayed.) If you want to make any comments you can use the text format by clicking on the box T in the tool bar or use the symbol #. 14.4 Arithmetic operations Arithmetic operators follow the same precedence rules as in Mathematics, and these are brackets, of, division, multiplication, addition and subtraction (BODMAS). Usual arithmetic operations can perform easily with Maple. [&gt; 312+121; &gt; 125-45; The * key is used for multiplication, / for division and ^ for the power. [&gt; 13*267; [&gt; 565/5; [&gt; 561/5; [&gt; 125-45; 13*267; 12345/5; #Three arithmetic operations [&gt; 2^5; [&gt; 2^(-5); [&gt; 3^40; Remark. Don’t use commas when you type large numbers in Maple. - For example: Compute the product 102,136,543 &amp; 20,077,410 . [&gt; 102136543*20077410; 14.5 Operations Maple adheres to the same order of operations that we use in Mathematics. By inserting parentheses, we can change this order. [&gt; 2+3*4-5*6; [&gt; 2+(3*4-5)*6; [&gt; (2+3)*4-5*6; [&gt; 29/(100-11*3^2); [&gt; (3^4-2^6)/(3^2-2^3); 14.5.1 Exercises Exercise 14.1 Calculate the followings \\(1428 + 456 − 41\\) \\(421 × 240 ÷ 55\\) \\((128 − 691 + 458) × 8\\) \\(2214875(201 × 11 − 55)\\) \\(201 ÷ (2012 − 1)\\) \\(21^{4^{2^3}}\\) Exercise 14.2 Compute \\(3^{400}\\). Find the command to find the length (number of digits) of a number. How many digits are there in the number \\(3^{400}\\) ? Does the above command give correct answer to the fractional numbers? 14.6 Shortcut to retyping One shortcut that we use often in Maple to retype is the % key. This refers to most recently executed result. [&gt; 13*23+1; [&gt; %/5; [&gt; %%/5; [&gt; %%%/5; [&gt; 12540*4; [&gt; %/4; [&gt; %/4; 14.7 Fractions and Decimals By simply entering a fraction Maple automatically reduce it. [&gt; 45/4; [&gt; 148/24; [&gt; 25/15; [&gt; 2/3+3/7; [&gt; 3/2+4/5-1/3; You can do calculations with decimal numbers also. [&gt; 25.361+124.6; [&gt; 2.138*0.013; [&gt; 56.101/0.102; 14.8 Roots [&gt; sqrt(16); [&gt; sqrt(30); [&gt; evalf(sqrt(30)); The evalf command numerically evaluates expressions (or sub-expressions) involving constants (for example, Pi, exp(1)) and mathematical functions (for example, exp, ln, sin). [&gt; 30^(1/2); [&gt; evalf(%); 14.8.1 Exercise Exercise 14.3 Compute the following: \\(11 + \\sqrt{31}\\) \\(\\sqrt[3]{64}\\) \\(\\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{3}}\\) Exercise 14.4 Calculate \\(120^8\\) Divide the answer by \\(10^8\\) Divide the answer in part i. by \\(2048 \\times 8\\) 14.9 Pi Vs pi \\(\\pi\\) is a constant in Mathematics and is recognized by maple and typed as Pi (Note the capitalization of “p” but not “i’). [&gt; Pi; [&gt; evalf(%); [&gt; evalf(2*Pi); If you use pi then evalf command does not return \\(\\pi\\) numerically. [&gt; pi; [&gt; evalf(%); 14.10 Rational Numbers Maple usually leaves fractions in fraction form. However, we can force it to express fractions in decimal form using the evalf command. [&gt; 1/7; [&gt; evalf(1/7); [&gt; 25/35; [&gt; evalf(%); Maple displays 10 decimal places as a default. If this is not enough and for better precision you can specify the exact number of decimal places as a second parameter to the evalf command. Note that the second parameter normally represents the number of non-zero digits in the answer. [&gt; evalf(1/7,100); [&gt; evalf(29/3,5); Here, if you want to calculate the answer for 4 decimal places the command should be evalf(29/3,5) and if you want the answer to be 5 decimal places the command should be evalf(29/3,6). [&gt; evalf(1/15,5); [&gt; evalf(11/19,5); Fractions are also rational numbers because their decimal expansions always have repeating blocks of digits. By looking at the decimal representation of a rational number you can see the repeating cycle. [&gt; evalf(1/35); Here we can not see the repeat cycle. But if we calculate \\(\\frac{1}{35}\\) for more decimal places we can see the repeating cycle. [&gt; evalf(1/35, 100); 14.10.1 Exercises Exercise 14.5 Evaluate the value of π correct up to 5 decimal places. Exercise 14.6 Find the area of a circle with radius 10cms Exercise 14.7 Check whether the followings are rational numbers or not \\(\\frac{1}{49}\\) \\(\\pi\\) \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) Exercise 14.8 How many digits are repeating in \\(\\frac{1}{212}\\) 14.11 Complex Numbers In Maple, complex arithmetic is normally done automatically with I standing for \\(\\sqrt{−1}\\) (for example, if you square I you will get -1, not I^2) [&gt; (-4+7*I)+(5-10*I); [&gt; 5*I-(-9+I); [&gt; (1-5*I)*(-9+2*I); [&gt; (3-I)/(2+7*I); But Maple does not always automatically evaluate an expression involving complex numbers. For example, it may leave an expression as the product of some complex numbers or as an expression involving a root of a complex number. [&gt; (-2*I)^(1/2); The function evalc to force Maple to evaluate as a complex number. [&gt; evalc((-2*I)^(1/2)); Note that evalc does not give you both the square roots of -2*I it only gives the principal value of the root. If you want to find the roots, use solve command as follows. [&gt; solve(z^2=-2*I); 14.11.1 Exercise Exercise 14.9 Simplify the following: \\((−3 + 3i) + (7 – 2i)\\) \\((5 + 3i) − (3 − i)\\) \\((1 + 2i)(1 − 2i) 4. (56 − 8i) ÷ (14 + 10i)\\) Exercise 14.10 Simplify \\((2i)^\\frac{1}{2}\\) by using evalc and solve commands. Exercise 14.11 Multiply the following and obtain the answer in standard form: \\[(2 − \\sqrt{−100})(1 + \\sqrt{−36})\\] 14.12 MAPLE Help Maple contains a complete online help system you can use to find information about specific topic easily and to explore the wide range of commands available. To get the information about commands, which you learn in MAPLE, you can use either one of the following. Topic search function F1 key ?
