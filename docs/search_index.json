Use the help command to find the general definition of a matrix. To work with Matrices first load the package linalg Which include most linear algebra related commands. 1.1 Defining matrices There are several ways to define Matrix. Let’s look at them through examples. You can use maple help. &gt; ? matrix &gt; restart; &gt; with(linalg): &gt; M1 :=matrix (3, 3, [1,-2,-3,2,-2,2,3,-3,3]); &gt; M2:= matrix(3,4,[1,1/2,-1/3,1/4,2,1/2,-3/4,5/4,3,3/5,3/7,3/8]); [&gt; A:= matrix(3,3,[[1,-3,-2],[2,-3,5],[-4,2,6]]); [&gt; B:=matrix([[1,-3,-2],[2,-3,5],[-4,2,6]]); [&gt; Matrix (2,2,fill=a); [&gt; Matrix (2,2,symbol=a); [&gt; f:=i-&gt;x*i-1; [&gt; M:=Matrix(2,f); [&gt; g:=(i,j)-&gt;x*(i+j—l); [&gt; M1:=Matrix(3,g); To define a diagonal matrix. [&gt; C:=diag(1,2,3); [&gt; diag(1,1,1); To define lower triangular matrix. [&gt; M_1:=Matrix(3,[[x],[y,y],[z,z,z]],shape=triangular[lower]); [&gt; M_2:=Matrix(3,[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]],shape=triangular[upper]); To define zero matrix [&gt; M_3:=Matrix(4,4,shape=zero); To define identity matrix [&gt; M_3:=Matrix(3,3,shape=identity); To find an entry of a matrix, follow the name of the matrix by indices inside a square bracket. [&gt; A:= matrix(3,3,[[1,-3,-2],[2,-3,5],[-4,2,6]]); [&gt; A[3,2]; [&gt; B:=matrix([[1,-3,-2],[2,-3,5],[-4,2,6]]); [&gt; B[1,2]; ## Matrix Operation 1.1.1 Addition and Scalar Multiplication Algebric expressions with matrices are evaluated by the command evalm. scalar multiplication of matrices done by the usual symbol *. [&gt; evalm(A+B); [&gt; evalm(2*A+3*B); 1.1.2 Matrix Multiplication For matrix multiplication the symbol &amp;* is used. [&gt; evalm(A&amp;*B); 1.1.3 Transpose To get the transpose of a matrix the command transpose is used. [&gt; transpose(A); 1.2 Row Opreations In your linear algebra class you will learn elementary row operations on matrices here we will use Maple to do the same thing. Let’s define a new matrix \\(A\\). addrow(A,r1,r2,m) Returns a copy of a matrix \\(A\\) in which row r2 replaced with by row(A,r2)+m*row(A,r1) [&gt; A:=matrix([[1,4,3,10],[2,1,-1,-1],[3,-1,4,11 [&gt; addrow(A,1,2,-2); [&gt; addrow(%,1,3,-3); mulrow(A,row,expr) Returns a matrix \\(A\\) in which has the same entries as \\(A\\) with the \\(r^{th}\\) row mutiplied by \\(expr\\) [&gt; mulrow(A,2,-1/7); [&gt; mulrow(%,3,-1/3); swaprow(A,r1,r2) This command interchange row r1 and r2 of \\(A\\) [&gt; swaprow(A,2,3); Similarly, you can learn addcol, mulcol,swapcol commands by your self. 1.3 Determinanat of Matrix To find the determinate of a matrix, maple has a special command det. [&gt; M1 :=matrix (3, 3, [1,-2,-3,2,-2,2,3,-3,3]); [&gt; det(M1); [&gt; B:=matrix([[1,-3,-2],[2,-3,5],[-4,2,6]]); [&gt; det(B); 1.3.1 Inverse of a matrix The inverse command is used to find the inverse of a square matrix, if exists. [&gt; B:=matrix([[1,-3,-2],[2,-3,5],[-4,2,6]]); [&gt; inverse(B); [&gt; inverse([[2,-1],[3,2]]); 1.4 Exercise Exercise 1.1 Performs the indicated computations.

A solution to a system consists of one or more sets of specific values that our common solutions to each of the individual equations. Here is a simple example which we can solve quite easily using the solve command. ## Augment of a matrix [&gt; with(linalg): [&gt; A:=matrix([[1,2],[2,3]]); Output: [&gt; B:=matrix([[3,4,5],[6,7,8]]); Output: augment(A,B); Output: The function augment joins two or more matrices together horizontally. The matrices and vectors must have the same number of rows. 2.1 Solving Linear Systems \\[ \\begin{array}{ccccccc} 2x &amp;+&amp; 5y &amp;-&amp; 4z &amp;=&amp; 9 \\\\ 3x &amp;+&amp; 5y &amp;+&amp; 2z &amp;=&amp; 12 \\\\ 4x &amp;-&amp; y &amp;+&amp; 5z &amp;=&amp; -3 \\end{array} \\] \\[ \\underbrace{\\begin{bmatrix} 2 &amp; 5 &amp; -4 \\\\ 3 &amp; 5 &amp; 2 \\\\ 4 &amp; -1 &amp; 5 \\end{bmatrix}}_A \\underbrace{\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y\\\\z \\end{bmatrix}}_X = \\underbrace{\\begin{bmatrix} 9\\\\12\\\\-3 \\end{bmatrix}}_B \\] 2.1.1 Method I A linear system is a collection of first degree equations. A solution to a system consists of one or more set of specific values that our common solution to each of the individual equations. Here is a simple example which we can solve quite easily using the solve command. [&gt; sys:={2*x+5*y-4*z=9,3*x+5*y+2*z=12,4*x-y+5*z=-3}; [&gt; solve(sys,{x,y,z}); Output: Maple will automatically use fractions, however you can force decimal answers using the evalf command. [&gt; evalf(%); Output: 2.1.2 Method II We can also convert the above system of equations to a matrix system. [&gt; A:=genmatrix(sys,[x,y,z],b); [&gt; evalm(b); Output: In this case , \\(A\\) is the coefficient matrix, and \\(b\\) is vector representing the constant values. The command evalm(b) evaluated \\(b\\) as a matrix (a vector is a \\(n \\times 1\\) matrix). In other words, this command simply writes out what the vector \\(b\\) looks like. [&gt; linsolve(A,b); Output: 2.1.3 Method III Another way to solve a matrix equation \\(Ax = b\\) is to left multiply both sides by the inverse matrix \\(A^{-1}\\), if it exists, to get the solution \\(x = A^{-1}b\\). [&gt; inverse(A); [&gt; evalm(inverse(A)&amp;*b); Output: The evalm command forces a matrix computation and express the result. 2.2 Dependent Systems: Some systems are dependent which means there are an infinite number of solutions. The form of these solutions will entail the use of parameters. Let’s look an example using two different methods; solve and linsolve. Example 2.1 \\[ \\begin{array}{ccccccccc} x &amp;-&amp; 2y&amp;+&amp; z &amp;=&amp; &amp;3\\\\ x &amp;+&amp; y &amp;-&amp; 2z&amp;=&amp;-&amp;4\\\\ 2x&amp;-&amp; y &amp;-&amp; z &amp;=&amp;-&amp;1 \\end{array} \\] [&gt; restart; [&gt; with(linalg): [&gt; sys:={x-2*y+z=3,x+y-2*z=-4,2*x-y-z=-1}; [&gt; solve(sys,{x,y,z}); output: [&gt; A:=genmatrix(sys,[x,y,z],b); [&gt; evalm(b); [&gt; linsolve(A,b); output: In both cases, the solution contains a parameter. The solve command express it in terms actual variable used,and the linsolve command use the funny t character to distinguish it from a variable you might have defined yourself. 2.3 Inconsistent System An Inconsistent system has no solution. Maple generally, refers to answer questions which have no answer. Example 2.2 \\[ \\begin{array}{ccccccccc} x &amp;+&amp; y &amp;-&amp; 3z &amp;= 10\\\\ x &amp;+&amp; y &amp;-&amp; z &amp;= 1\\\\ x &amp;+&amp; y &amp;+&amp; z &amp;= 8 \\end{array} \\] Let’s try to solve this system. [&gt; restart; [&gt; with(linalg): [&gt; sys:={x+y-3*z=10,x+y-z=1,x+y+z=8}; [&gt; solve(sys,{x,y,z}); Output: This method does not work. It does not return anything. Let’s try linsolve method. [&gt; A:=genmatrix(sys,[x,y,z],b); [&gt; linsolve(A,b); Output: This method also does not works. [&gt; evalm(inverse(A)&amp;*b); Output: 2.3.0.1 Automatic Reduction [&gt; sys:={3*x+5*y+2*z=12,2*x+5*y-4*z=9,4*x-y+5*z=-3}; [&gt; evalm(b); [&gt; C:=augment(A,b); Output: 2.3.1 Method IV An even faster method is simplifying let maple to do all the work for us. The gausselim command will perform all of the steps of Gaussian eliminations and reduce an augmented matrix to row echelon form. [&gt; sys:={3*x+5*y-2*z=12,2*x+5*y-4*z=9,4*x-y+5*z=-3}; [&gt; A:=genmatrix(sys,[x,y,z],b); [&gt; evalm(b); [&gt; C:=augment(A,b); [&gt; gausselim(C); 2.3.2 Method V The command gaussjord does the same thing. It performs all the steps of Gauss Jordan elimination and reduces and reduces an augmented matrix into reduced row echelon form. [&gt; gaussjord(C); 2.4 Exercise Exercise 2.1 Solve the following system of equations. \\[ \\begin{array}{ccccccc} x_1 &amp;+&amp; 2x_2 &amp;+&amp; 3x_3 &amp;= 9 \\\\ 2x_1 &amp;-&amp; x_2 &amp;+&amp; x_3 &amp;= 8 \\\\ 3x_1 &amp; &amp; &amp;-&amp; x_3&amp;= 3 \\end{array} \\] Exercise 2.2 A small manufacturing plant makes three types of inflatable boats: one-person, two-person, and four-person models. Each boat requires the services of three departments, as listed in the table. The cutting, assembly, and packaging departments have available a maximum of 380, 330, and 120 labor hours per week, respectively. Department One Person Boat Two-Person Boat Four-Person Boat Cutting 0.5 hr 1.0 hr 1.5 hr Assembling 0.6 hr 0.9 hr 1.2 hr Packaging 0.2 hr 0.3 hr 0.5 hr How many boats of each type must be produced each week for the plant to operate at full capacity? How is the production schedule in part A affected if the packaging department is no longer used? How is the production schedule in part A affected if the four-person boat is no longer produced?

Where there are constants, Parameters other variable around, Maple assume that you mean to take the integral as the variable you specify changes, and that all other letters in the expression represent constants. 3.2 Definite Integration [&gt; Int(g(x),x=a..b); [&gt; Int(x^2*exp(x),x=0..2)=int(x^2*exp(x),x=0..2); [&gt; f := x -&gt; x*sin(x); [&gt; int(f(x),x=0..Pi); Some functions can not be integrated analytically, but the definite integrals of such functions still have meaning and MAPLE can determine them. [&gt; int(exp(-x^2)*ln(x),x); [&gt; int(exp(-x^2)*ln(x),x=0..infinity); [&gt; evalf(%); 3.3 Integration by Parts The intparts command is used to integrate by parts, and the command exist in student package. The intparts command has two arguments: the first is the expression to be anti-differentiated, and the second is the choice for, the piece which is to be differentiated. \\[ \\int u D(v) dx = uv - \\int v D(u) dx \\] Example 3.1 Method of integration by parts to compute \\(\\int x \\cos(x)\\) [&gt; restart; [&gt; with(student): [&gt; p1:= Int(x*cos(x),x); [&gt; p2:= intparts(p1,x); [&gt; p3:= value(p2); [&gt; p1 = p3 + C; [&gt; restart; [&gt; with(student): [&gt; Int(sqrt(x)*ln(x),x)=intparts(Int(sqrt(x)*ln(x),x),ln(x)); [&gt; Int(sqrt(x)*ln(x),x)=value(intparts(Int(sqrt(x)*ln(x),x),ln(x))); 3.4 Substitutions These are done using the changevar command. Look at the following example. Example 3.2 Evaluate \\(\\int 4 \\cos(\\sin(x)) dx\\) using the substitution, \\(u=\\cos(x)\\) . [&gt; Int(cos(x)^4*sin(x),x)=changevar(u=cos(x),Int(cos(x)^4*sin(x),x),u); [&gt; v1:=value(changevar(u=cos(x),Int(cos(x)^4*sin(x),x),u)); To back-substitute, we use the subs command, [&gt; subs(u=cos(x),v1); 3.5 Multiple Integration 3.5.1 Double integration (Area calculation) [&gt; Int(Int(x^2+2*x,x),x); [&gt; int(int(x^2+2*x,x),x); [&gt; Int(Int(x+y^2,y=0..x),x=1..2); [&gt; a:=Int(x+y^2,y=0..x); [&gt; b:=Int(a,x=1..2); [&gt; Int(Int(x+y^2,y=0..x),x=1..2)=int(int(x+y^2,y=0..x),x=1..2); [&gt; A:=Doubleint(x+y^2,y=0..x,x=1..2); [&gt; value(A); 3.5.2 Triple integration (Volume Calculation) [&gt; Int(Int(Int(x^3*exp(y)*sin(z),x=0..2),z=-Pi..2*Pi),y=0..1)=int(int(int(x^3*exp(y)*sin(z),x=0..2),z=-Pi..2*Pi),y=0..1); [&gt; V:=Tripleint(x^3*exp(y)*sin(z),x=0..2,z=-Pi..2*Pi,y=0..1); [&gt; value(V); Note: Since there is often more than one way to find an indefinite integral, it may happen that the answer you obtain by doing the techniques seen in class is different than the one obtained with Maple. 3.6 Exercise Exercise 3.1 Integrate the following expressions, \\(2x^2 + \\frac{x}{2}\\) \\(x^3(3x^2 + 2)^{\\frac{5}{3}}\\) \\(e^{-x^2}\\) Exercise 3.2 Find the definite integral of the following over the given intervals, \\(\\int_{2}^{10} x^3(3x^2 + 2)^{\\frac{5}{3}} \\, dx\\) \\(\\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\cos(x) \\sin(x^2) \\, dx\\) \\(\\int_{0}^{\\pi} e^x \\cos(x) \\, dx\\) \\(\\int_{0}^{\\pi} e^{2\\sin(x)}\\cos(x) \\, dx\\) Exercise 3.3 Use of the method of integration by parts to compute, \\(\\int x e^{-2x} \\, dx\\) \\(\\int x \\ln(x) \\, dx\\) Exercise 3.4 Evaluate the following expressions \\(\\int_{-3}^3 \\int_{-3}^3 3x^2 + 5y^2 +4 \\, dxdy\\) \\(\\int_{-3}^3 \\int_{-3}^3 9 \\ln(x) - 5y^2 \\, dxdy\\) Note: Since there is often more than one way to find an indefinite integral, it may happen that the answer you obtain by doing the techniques seen in class is different than the one obtained with Maple. Compare the answers obtained by Maple and the answer you obtained manually for the integral, \\(\\int \\cos(3x)\\,dx\\) There are two main ways to use the definite integral. - The easiest one to understand is as a means for computing areas (and volumes). - The second way the definite integral is used is as a sum.
