Maple is a Symbolic Computation System or Computer Algebra System which can be used to obtain exact analytical solutions to many mathematical problems, including integrals, systems of equations, differential equations, and problems in linear algebra. It also has the capability of plotting functions in 2D and 3D and displaying animations. Maple can perform calculations in binding speed, but one has to be responsible for making these calculations meaningfully and mathematically correct. 1.2 Using a Maple Worksheet The following figure shows the Maple window with a blank Maple worksheet and this window contains: a menu bar across the top with menus: a tool bar immediately below the menu bar, with button-based short cuts to common operations; a context bar directly below the tool bar, with controls specific to the task being performed; The menu bar, tool bar, and context bar. a window, containing a Maple prompt [&gt;, called a worksheet; a status bar at the bottom, with boxes marked Ready, Time and Memory From the File menu, select the options Save or Save As to save the active Maple classic worksheet. Maple classic worksheets are saved with the extension “.mws”, but in the standard interface, Maple worksheets are saved with the extension “.mw” 1.3 Entering Maple Commands The “ &gt; ” is the command prompt in Maple. That is where you type your commands or statements. Every command in Maple should end with a semicolon(;) or a colon(:). (If you use a semicolon then the result of the command will be displayed. If you use a colon then the result will not be displayed.) If you want to make any comments you can use the text format by clicking on the box T in the tool bar or use the symbol #. Video 1.4 Arithmetic operations Arithmetic operators follow the same precedence rules as in Mathematics, and these are brackets, of, division, multiplication, addition and subtraction (BODMAS). Usual arithmetic operations can perform easily with Maple. [&gt; 312+121; &gt; 125-45; The * key is used for multiplication, / for division and ^ for the power. [&gt; 13*267; [&gt; 565/5; [&gt; 561/5; [&gt; 125-45; 13*267; 12345/5; #Three arithmetic operations [&gt; 2^5; [&gt; 2^(-5); [&gt; 3^40; Remark. Don’t use commas when you type large numbers in Maple. - For example: Compute the product 102,136,543 &amp; 20,077,410 . [&gt; 102136543*20077410; 1.5 Operations Maple adheres to the same order of operations that we use in Mathematics. By inserting parentheses, we can change this order. [&gt; 2+3*4-5*6; [&gt; 2+(3*4-5)*6; [&gt; (2+3)*4-5*6; [&gt; 29/(100-11*3^2); [&gt; (3^4-2^6)/(3^2-2^3); 1.5.1 Exercises Exercise 1.1 Calculate the followings \\(1428 + 456 − 41\\) \\(421 × 240 ÷ 55\\) \\((128 − 691 + 458) × 8\\) \\(2214875(201 × 11 − 55)\\) \\(201 ÷ (2012 − 1)\\) \\(21^{4^{2^3}}\\) Exercise 1.2 Compute \\(3^{400}\\). Find the command to find the length (number of digits) of a number. How many digits are there in the number \\(3^{400}\\) ? Does the above command give correct answer to the fractional numbers? 1.6 Shortcut to retyping One shortcut that we use often in Maple to retype is the % key. This refers to most recently executed result. [&gt; 13*23+1; [&gt; %/5; [&gt; %%/5; [&gt; %%%/5; [&gt; 12540*4; [&gt; %/4; [&gt; %/4; 1.7 Fractions and Decimals By simply entering a fraction Maple automatically reduce it. [&gt; 45/4; [&gt; 148/24; [&gt; 25/15; [&gt; 2/3+3/7; [&gt; 3/2+4/5-1/3; You can do calculations with decimal numbers also. [&gt; 25.361+124.6; [&gt; 2.138*0.013; [&gt; 56.101/0.102; 1.8 Roots [&gt; sqrt(16); [&gt; sqrt(30); [&gt; evalf(sqrt(30)); The evalf command numerically evaluates expressions (or sub-expressions) involving constants (for example, Pi, exp(1)) and mathematical functions (for example, exp, ln, sin). [&gt; 30^(1/2); [&gt; evalf(%); 1.8.1 Exercise Exercise 1.3 Compute the following: \\(11 + \\sqrt{31}\\) \\(\\sqrt[3]{64}\\) \\(\\sqrt{2}^{\\sqrt{3}}\\) Exercise 1.4 Calculate \\(120^8\\) Divide the answer by \\(10^8\\) Divide the answer in part i. by \\(2048 \\times 8\\) 1.9 Pi Vs pi \\(\\pi\\) is a constant in Mathematics and is recognized by maple and typed as Pi (Note the capitalization of “p” but not “i’). [&gt; Pi; [&gt; evalf(%); [&gt; evalf(2*Pi); If you use pi then evalf command does not return \\(\\pi\\) numerically. [&gt; pi; [&gt; evalf(%); 1.10 Rational Numbers Maple usually leaves fractions in fraction form. However, we can force it to express fractions in decimal form using the evalf command. [&gt; 1/7; [&gt; evalf(1/7); [&gt; 25/35; [&gt; evalf(%); Maple displays 10 decimal places as a default. If this is not enough and for better precision you can specify the exact number of decimal places as a second parameter to the evalf command. Note that the second parameter normally represents the number of non-zero digits in the answer. [&gt; evalf(1/7,100); [&gt; evalf(29/3,5); Here, if you want to calculate the answer for 4 decimal places the command should be evalf(29/3,5) and if you want the answer to be 5 decimal places the command should be evalf(29/3,6). [&gt; evalf(1/15,5); [&gt; evalf(11/19,5); Fractions are also rational numbers because their decimal expansions always have repeating blocks of digits. By looking at the decimal representation of a rational number you can see the repeating cycle. [&gt; evalf(1/35); Here we can not see the repeat cycle. But if we calculate \\(\\frac{1}{35}\\) for more decimal places we can see the repeating cycle. [&gt; evalf(1/35, 100); 1.10.1 Exercises Exercise 1.5 Evaluate the value of π correct up to 5 decimal places. Exercise 1.6 Find the area of a circle with radius 10cms Exercise 1.7 Check whether the followings are rational numbers or not \\(\\frac{1}{49}\\) \\(\\pi\\) \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) Exercise 1.8 How many digits are repeating in \\(\\frac{1}{212}\\) 1.11 Complex Numbers In Maple, complex arithmetic is normally done automatically with I standing for \\(\\sqrt{−1}\\) (for example, if you square I you will get -1, not I^2) [&gt; (-4+7*I)+(5-10*I); [&gt; 5*I-(-9+I); [&gt; (1-5*I)*(-9+2*I); [&gt; (3-I)/(2+7*I); But Maple does not always automatically evaluate an expression involving complex numbers. For example, it may leave an expression as the product of some complex numbers or as an expression involving a root of a complex number. [&gt; (-2*I)^(1/2); The function evalc to force Maple to evaluate as a complex number. [&gt; evalc((-2*I)^(1/2)); Note that evalc does not give you both the square roots of -2*I it only gives the principal value of the root. If you want to find the roots, use solve command as follows. [&gt; solve(z^2=-2*I); 1.11.1 Exercise Exercise 1.9 Simplify the following: \\((−3 + 3i) + (7 – 2i)\\) \\((5 + 3i) − (3 − i)\\) \\((1 + 2i)(1 − 2i) 4. (56 − 8i) ÷ (14 + 10i)\\) Exercise 1.10 Simplify \\((2i)^\\frac{1}{2}\\) by using evalc and solve commands. Exercise 1.11 Multiply the following and obtain the answer in standard form: \\[(2 − \\sqrt{−100})(1 + \\sqrt{−36})\\] 1.12 MAPLE Help Maple contains a complete online help system you can use to find information about specific topic easily and to explore the wide range of commands available. To get the information about commands, which you learn in MAPLE, you can use either one of the following. Topic search function F1 key ? In front of the command "],["basic-algebra.html", "Lesson 2 Basic Algebra 2.1 Variables and Expressions 2.2 Assigning values to variables 2.3 Substituting Values 2.4 Factoring expressions 2.5 Expanding expressions 2.6 Finding the degree and leading coefficient of polynomials 2.7 Simplifying Expressions", " Lesson 2 Basic Algebra 2.1 Variables and Expressions Study how we write the following expressions in Maple. [&gt; 3*x; [&gt; 2+3*x; [&gt; x^2; [&gt; 1/(x-2); 2.1.1 Exercise Exercise 2.1 Generate the following expressions using maple commands. \\((2x + 3)(4x + 5)\\) \\(9x^2 − 4\\) \\(\\frac{2x}{5}+\\frac{y}{5}\\) \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2x+1}}{3+y}\\) 2.2 Assigning values to variables Maple will store things (numbers, expressions, functions,…) in ‘containers’ or ‘variables’. This process is called assignment, and you can assign values to the variables by using := or using the command assign. After assigning a value to a variable it becomes a constant and Maple will remember that value from that point. Method I [&gt; x:=5; [&gt; x^2; [&gt; 2*x+23; Method II [&gt; assign(y,5); [&gt; y^2; You can also define variables in a descriptive manner. However they must begin with a character and any blank spaces must not be included. Note that maple is case sensitive. [&gt; Age:=21; [&gt; age; [&gt; Age; [&gt; Exam_No:=2012300; [&gt; New Age:=Age+4; # There should not be any blank spaces when giving a name for the variable [&gt; New_Age:=Age+4; If you want to reset the predefined value for variables you have to use following methods. Method I: restart command [&gt; restart; [&gt; Age; Method II : unassign The unassign command unassigns all the unevaluated names given as input. [&gt; x:=5; [&gt; x+20; [&gt; unassign(&#39;x&#39;); [&gt; x+20; 2.3 Substituting Values To substitute numbers (or other expressions) in the place of variables in an algebraic expression without permanently changing the values of the variable, we use the command, subs(variable, expression). Try to use help [&gt; ?subs &gt; x; &gt; subs(x=2,x+5); &gt; subs(x=2,x^2-5*x+4); It is convenient to make substitution by giving name for an expression. &gt; expr:=(2*x+1)/(5-3*x); &gt; subs(x=3,expr); You can even substitute other variables or expressions to a variable in an expression. &gt; subs(x=a,expr); &gt; subs(x=a+1,expr); You can also substitute more than one variable for a expression. [&gt; expr1:=(7*x-3*y)/(x^2-y^2); [&gt; subs({x=3,y=2},expr1); [&gt; subs({x=a-2,y=a+2},expr1); [&gt; expr2:=x^2+2*y^2+z^2; [&gt; subs({x=1,y=2,z=3},expr2); 2.4 Factoring expressions Maple can factorize an integer into primes using the command ifactor. [&gt; ifactor(18); [&gt; ifactor(525); [&gt; ifactor(2^8-1); 2.5 Expanding expressions One of the most important things Maple can do is to calculate with expressions as well as numbers and we use the command expand to get the expansion of an expression. 2.6 Finding the degree and leading coefficient of polynomials The highest power of the variable that occurs in the polynomial is called the degree of a polynomial. The leading term is the term with the highest power, and its coefficient is called the leading coefficient. If \\(x\\) is a single indeterminate, the degree and ldegree commands compute the degree and low degree respectively, of the polynomial \\(p\\) in \\(x\\). [&gt; p:=(x+5)^5; [&gt; expand(%); [&gt; degree(p,x); [&gt; ldegree(p,x); The coeff(p, x^n) command finds the coefficient of \\(x^n\\) in the polynomial \\(p\\) where \\(p\\) is the polynomial in \\(x\\) and \\(n\\) is the integer corresponds to the power. When finding the leading coefficient, \\(n\\) corresponds to the highest power in the polynomial. [&gt; coeff(p,x^5); [&gt; coeff(p,x,5); #Another way of finding leading coefficient 2.6.1 Exercise Exercise 2.2 Generate the expression \\(x^3 + \\sqrt{x}\\) using maple commands and find the value of the expression when \\(x = 4\\). Exercise 2.3 \\(PQR\\) is an isosceles triangle where \\( =  = 2 + 3\\) and \\( =  + 3\\). Find an expression for the perimeter of the \\(\\) triangle in terms of \\(\\), giving your answer in its simplest form and find the perimeter when \\( = 8\\). Exercise 2.4 Factorize the following expressions: \\(3x^2 + 8x + 5\\) \\(x^4 − 3x^2 + 2\\) \\(36^{13}^{10} − 40^{11}^{11}\\) \\(24389x^{12} − 2197\\) Exercise 2.5 Expand the following expressions, find the degree, lower degree and the leading coefficients. \\((5x − 11)^{13}\\) \\((x^2 + x + 1)\\)^{10}) 2.7 Simplifying Expressions 2.7 Simplifying Expressions [&gt; 3*(x-1)+7*(x+2)-5*(x+11); Maple will automatically simplify some simple expressions. However, more complicated expressions will not be simplified. So, we need to give a command to simplify such expressions.

The solution may be an integer, a fraction, or it may be an expression. Using Maple we can do the same thing using the solve command and obtain an exact solutions for equations and inequalities. 3.2 Equations with multiple unknowns You can use the solve command to solve equations having several variables. However you have to specify, for which variable that the equation to be solved. 3.3 Functions Let \\(f\\) be a function of \\(x\\).

In order to use a package, you have to load the package first using the with command. Example &gt; with(student): &gt; with(linalg): So, when you are dealing with plots, you have to load the package plot. &gt; with(plots): 4.1 Basic Graphs Using the plot command you can graph a function. You have to give the range of values for \\(x\\) otherwise Maple will use the default range. [&gt; plot(x^2+1,x=-3..3); [&gt; plot(abs(x),x=-infinity..infinity); [&gt; f:=x-&gt;2*x^3+2*x+1; [&gt; plot(f(x),x=-3..3); You can give the vertical range also. [&gt; plot(4-(x-3)^2,x=-5..5,y=-5..5); You can customize your plots using various formatting options within the plot command. Here are some of the key options: Color: color=n Allows specifying the color of the curves to be plotted Labels: labels=[x, y] This option specifies labels for the axes. For information on how to specify x and y. The default labels are the names of the variables in the original function to be plotted, if these are available; otherwise, no labels are used. Legend: legend=s Legend entry for a plot. If the plot command is being used to plot multiple curves, then s can be a list containing a legend entry for each curve. Linestyle: linestyle=t Controls the line style of curves. The linestyle value t can be one of the following names: solid, dot, dash, dashdot, longdash, spacedash, or spacedot. The default value of t is solid. The value t can also be an integer from 1 to 7, where each integer represents a line style, as given in the order above. Title: title=t The title for the plot. The value t can be an arbitrary expression. The value t can also be a list consisting of the title followed by the font option. The default is no title. Example 4.1 .a [&gt; plot(sinh(x), x=-Pi..Pi, title=&quot;sinh graph&quot;,color=[blue]); Example 4.2 .a plot(sin(x),x=-2*Pi..2*Pi,title=&quot;sine Graph&quot;,color=[green]); 4.2 Multiple Graphs If you want to compare plots, you can have two or more plot windows open at the same time or you can plot more than one curve on the same set of axes. The plot command offers options which control the number of points at which the function is plotted, the number of tick marks on the axes and the placing of titles on the graph. Read the help page on plot to find out about these options. Example 4.3 .a [&gt; plot([x^2,(x-2)^2+2,-x^2-2],x=-5..5,y=-10..10,title=&quot;multiple graphs&quot;,color=[blue,magenta,green]); Example 4.4 . . a [&gt; plot([sin(x),cos(x),tan(x)],x=-Pi..Pi,y=-5..5,title=&quot;SimpleTrigFunctions&quot;,legend=[&quot;sin(x)&quot;,&quot;cos(x)&quot;,&quot;tan(x)&quot;],linestyle=[1,20,25],color=[red,blue,green]); Example 4.5 . . a [&gt; p1:=plot(x^3-2*x^2+1,x=-Pi..Pi,style=point,color=[blue]): [&gt; p2:=plot(5*x^2+0.005*cos(x)^2,x=-Pi..Pi,style=line,color=[magenta]): [&gt; plots[display]({p1,p2}); Example 4.6 …a [&gt; f:=x-&gt;5*x/(2*x+9): [&gt; g:=x-&gt;sqrt(x-3): [&gt; plot([f(x),g(x)],x=-25..10,y=-5..5,labels=[x,y],title=&quot;Plot of Two Functions&quot;, legend=[&quot;f(x)&quot;,&quot;g(x)&quot;]); 4.3 Discontinuous Graphs The graph \\(y=\\frac{1}{x+1}\\) has a flow. There appears to be vertical line at \\(x=1\\) , when really the function is not defined at \\(x=1\\). This happens because Maple assumes graphs are continuous, so it tries to keep the graph connected by drawing that extra line. We can fix this problem by telling maple to expect discontinuities. [&gt; plot(1/(2-x),x=-5..5,y=-2..2); [&gt; plot(1/(2-x),x=-5..5,y=-2..2,discont=true); [&gt; plot(floor(x),x=-5..5,thickness=2,color=gold); [&gt; plot(floor(x),x=-5..5,thickness=2,color=gold,discont=true); floor(x) is a function which produce the greatest integer less than or equal to a given \\(x\\). 4.4 Graphing Lines You can now plot the graphs of the lines of the form \\(y=mx+c\\). So how to plot lines having the form \\(ax+by=c\\) ? [&gt; line1:=3*x-7*y=8; [&gt; solve(%,y); [&gt; plot(%,x=-3..3,y=-2..2,thickness=3); 4.5 Plotting Piecewise Continuous Functions Plotting Piecewise Continuous Functions If you wish to plot an expression which is defined in a piecewise way, then use the Maple command piecewise. For example, to plot the expression \\(f(x)\\) which is mathematically, \\[ f(x)=\\begin{cases} 0 &amp; \\text{ if } &amp; x&lt;0\\\\ x^2 &amp; \\text{ if } &amp; 0 \\leq x &lt; 1\\\\ 2x-1 &amp; \\text{ if } &amp; 1 \\leq x \\end{cases} \\] you can use the command: [&gt; fx:=piecewise(x&lt;0,0,0&lt;=x and x&lt;=1,x^2,x&gt;1,2*x-1); Now to plot this for \\(x\\) between -5 and 5 , simply type [&gt; plot(fx,x=-5..5); [&gt; gx:=piecewise(x&lt;1,-x+1,1&lt;=x and x&lt;=4,2*x+3,x^2); [&gt; plot(gx,x=-5..5,discont=true); 4.6 Finding one to one functions Not every function has an inverse function. This is a special property. What is the criteria which determines whether or not a given function has an inverse? Only functions which are one-to-one have inverses. Definition 4.1 A function is one-to-one if every \\(x\\) in domain takes a unique value of \\(y\\). This is usually expressed in the following way, which is not always easy to understand. A function is one-to-one if whenever \\(f(a)=f(b)\\), then \\(a=b\\). In other words, if it appears that two different \\(x\\) values share the same \\(y\\) value. &gt; f:=x-&gt;(x-2)/(x-7); &gt; f(a)=f(b); &gt; isolate(%,a); &gt; display(plot({k/2$k=-4..4},x=-4..4,color=red),plot({f(x)},x=-4..4,thickness=3,color=green)); This equation \\(f(a)=f(b)\\) can be solved and has a single unique solution. That means the values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the same. Thus the function is one-to-one. When looking at the graph of a function, it is easy to see if its one-to-one. If every horizontal line crosses the function only once, then the function is one-to-one. However, if there is even one horizontal line which crosses in two or more places, it is not one-to-one. Example 4.7 Determine whether if \\(f(x)=2x\\sqrt{|x|}\\) is one to one or not? [&gt; f:=x-&gt;2*x*sqrt(abs(x)); If you try to solve \\(f(a) = f(b)\\) as we did above, even Maple has some trouble. [&gt; f(a)=f(b); [&gt; isolate(%,a); Let’s look at the graph. [&gt; display(plot({k/2$k=-9..9},x=-Pi..2*Pi,color=red),plot({f(x)},x=2..2, thickness=3, color= green)); 4.7 Graphing the inverse There is an interesting relationship between the graph of \\(f(x)\\) and graph of its inverse. They are mirror images of each other through the line \\(y=x\\) . for every point \\((x,y)\\) on the graph of \\(f(x)\\), there corresponds a point \\((y,x)\\) on the graph of the inverse. &gt; plot({exp(x),ln(x),x},x=-infinity..infinity,color=[green,blue,red]); &gt; plot([sin(x),arcsin(x),x],x=-0.5*Pi..0.5*Pi,y=-0.5*Pi..0.5*Pi,color=[green,blue,red]); &gt; plot([cos(x),arccos(x),x],x=0..0.5*Pi,y=-0.5*Pi..0.5*Pi,color=[green,blue,red]); 4.8 Solving system of equations graphically For example, let us solve the following system of equations both algebraically and graphically. \\[ \\begin{align} -x&amp;+3y&amp;=10\\\\ x&amp;+y&amp;=02 \\end{align} \\] [&gt; solve({-x+3*y-10,x+y-2},{x,y}); Now let us do it graphically: First solve each equation for \\(y\\).

First let’s look at the simplest command plot, which is contained in the main Maple library. In Maple you can plot ordered pairs. [&gt; plot(set_of_ordered_pairs,style=POINT); Example: [&gt; plot([[1, 2], [3, 1], [-2, 1]],style=POINT); Polar plots &gt; polarplot(2,t=0..Pi); You can draw different types of polygons with Maple plots. Try out the following: [&gt; polygonplot([[-1,2],[-3,4],[1,2]]); [&gt; polygonplot([[-1,1],[3,1],[5,5],[1,8],[3,5]],color=magenta); 4.10 3D plots [&gt; restart; [&gt; with(plots): [&gt; plot3d(sin(x*y),x=-Pi/2..Pi/2,y=-Pi..Pi); Video [&gt; plot3d((1.3)^x * sin(y), x=-1..2*Pi, y=0..Pi, coords=spherical, style=patch); Video 4.11 Exercise Plot the following functions in a suitable domain: \\(x^3 - 12x^2 + 30x - 10\\) \\(\\sqrt{x} - 1\\) \\(2x^3 + 3x^2 + 1 - \\sin(x)\\) \\(x^4 - 94\\) Plot the functions \\(x^3\\), \\(x^3 - 2x\\), \\(x^3 + 2x\\) on the same axis using the domain \\(x = [-2, 2]\\).

It is part of the linalg package. There are two commands for entering a vector in Maple. Those are array and vector. [&gt; with(linalg): [&gt; u:=array([a,b,c]); [&gt; v:=vector([a,b,c]); [&gt; w:=&lt;a|b|c&gt;; Defining a vector with specified elements: [&gt; a:=vector([1,2,3]); [&gt; b:=vector(3,[-1,2,3]); Defining a vector with 3 unspecified elements will gives you a symbolic vector of dimension three. [&gt; c:=vector(3); [&gt; evalm(c); [&gt; u:=vector([3,-2,0,2,-3]); If a vector u is defined, we can access the \\(n\\)th element of the vector u by the command u[n]. We can insert variables as the entries of vectors: [&gt; v := vector([x,y,2*x]); [&gt; v[1]+v[3]^2; Given below is the function form of the “vector” command. [&gt; w := vector(7, i -&gt; i^2-1); This \\(w\\) vector contains the \\(n^2-1\\) form of the first seven positive integers. \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). 5.2 Vector Algebra Maple can handle most of the common operations with vectors. 5.2.1 Vector addition The commonly used algebra operations on vectors are as follows: [&gt; u:=vector([2,-1,1]); [&gt; v:=vector([0,3,-2]); [&gt; u+v; Notice that just typing \\(u+v\\) doesn’t work the way you expect. To see the entries you need to use evalm which stands for Evaluate as a Matrix. So now: &gt; evalm(u+v); &gt; evalm(u-v); 5.2.2 Multiplication by a scalar [&gt; evalm(2*v); [&gt; evalm(3*u+2*v); 5.2.3 Dot product and cross product To do the dot and cross products, you have the commands dotprod and crossprod. But you must load the linalg package before entering those commands. But you must load the ‘linalg’ package before entering those commands. [&gt; with(linalg): [&gt; dotprod(u,v); [&gt; crossprod(u,v); [&gt; crossprod([1,2,3],[-2,0,1]); 5.2.4 Scalar triple product There are two methods to get the scalar triple product. [&gt; u:=vector([3,-1,2]); [&gt; v:=vector([5,7,1]); [&gt; w:=vector([0,1,2]); Method I dotprod(u,crossprod(v,w)); Method II det(augment(u,v,w)); 5.2.5 Magnitude of a vector Method I [&gt; u:=vector([2,-1,1]); [&gt; sqrt(dotprod(u,u)); [&gt; sqrt(dotprod(v,v)); Method II &gt; norm(v,2); &gt; norm(v,2); Using the norm command you can find the unit vector corresponding to a given vector. [&gt; u/norm(u,2); [&gt; evalm(%); [&gt; evalm(v/norm(v,2)); 5.2.6 Angle between two vectors [&gt; angle(u,v); [&gt; evalf(%); Note that, in here the angle is given in radians. 5.2.7 Line joining two points and mid point of line Let \\(p,q\\) be two position vectors. Then you can find the vector representing the line joining these two points by evaluating \\(q-p\\). [&gt; p:=vector([3,-1,2]); [&gt; q:=vector([5,7,1]); [&gt; evalm(q-p); You can find the midpoint of the line as well. [&gt; evalm((q+p)/2); 5.3 Geometrical representation of vectors Vectors are determined by both a magnitude and a direction and they are represented geometrically in 2 or 3 dimensional space as directed line segments or arrows. We can represent vectors graphically using the arrow and display commands from the plots package. [&gt; restart;with(plots): The arrow command has the following format: arrow(vector,options) or arrow(base,direction,options)   For the options, you may use a bigger width if the arrow appears to be too small. For example, in 2-dimensional plane plot the vector \\(\\vec u=(3,5)\\) &gt; arrow([3,5],width=0.1,head_length=0.5,axes=normal,color=red); For example, in 3-dimensional plane plot the vector \\(\\vec v = (1,−2,4)\\) [&gt; v:=vector([1,-2,4]); [&gt; V1:=arrow(v): [&gt; display(V1,axes=normal,labels=[x,y,z]); The angle of vision can be moved by clicking on the graph and moving your mouse (with the button still pressed down). 5.3.1 Sum of two vectors The sum of two vectors \\(v_1\\) and \\(v_2\\), written \\(v_1+v_2\\) is the vector geometrically determined as follows.

First, we need to load the DEtools library: We can find the derivative of a given function by using diff command. - The diff command computes the partial derivative of a given expression with respect to the variables given. - The Diff command returns the unevaluated function. Now consider the following examples. Example 7.1 Find the derivative of \\(y=xe^x\\) with respect to \\(x\\). [&gt; with(DEtools): [&gt; y:=x-&gt;x*exp(-x); [&gt; Diff(y(x),x); [&gt; diff(y(x),x); [&gt; Diff(y(x),x)=diff(y(x),x); Example 7.2 Consider the follwing function \\(h\\) of two varibels. \\[h(x,y)=5x^2 + 2x^2y + 3xy^2 + 12yx + \\frac{3y^3}{x}\\] Now we are going to differentiate \\(h\\) partially. The next few commands have been done in order to understand the process. First, we define the function \\(h\\). [&gt; h :=(x,y)-&gt; 5*x^2+2*x^2*y+3*x*y^2+12*y*x+3*y^3/x; Then, [&gt; Diff( h(x,y),x); [&gt; diff( h(x,y),x); [&gt; Diff( h(x,y),x)=diff( h(x,y),x); [&gt; Diff(h(x,y),y); [&gt; diff(h(x,y),y); [&gt; Diff(h(x,y),y)=diff(h(x,y),y); Here we are going to differentiate the function \\(h\\) with respect to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), using them both in one command. Here the function \\(h\\) should be differentiate first with respect to \\(x\\), and then again with respect to \\(y\\). [&gt; diff( h(x,y),x,y); Now, the function h should be differentiate first with respect to \\(y\\), and then again with respect to \\(x\\). [&gt; diff( h(x,y),y,x); First define the function in Maple. Then you can find the derivative as follows. Example 7.3 Define the differential equation \\(y&#39; =y(4-y\\) [&gt; diff(y(t),t) = y(t)*(4-y(t)); We cannot drop the ‘\\((t)\\)’ from the dependent variable \\(y\\).

[&gt; d1_2:=diff(y(x),x$2); Also you can find higher derivatives by changing \\(n\\). x$n As an example the fifth derivative of the above function as follows. [&gt; d1_5:=diff(y(x),x$5); ### Exercise Certainly! Let’s express the given expressions in LaTeX and compute their derivatives: Example 7.4 Let \\(f(x) = x^2 \\sin(kx^3)\\). Compute the 3rd derivative, \\(f_{xxx}\\) of \\(f(x)\\). Evaluate \\(f_{xxx}\\) at \\(x = 1\\) and \\(k = 3\\).

If \\(y = x^2 \\sin(x)\\), then \\(\\frac{8y}{x} - 4\\frac{dy}{dx} + x\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = -(x^2 - 2)\\sin(x)\\). 7.3 Homogenous Equations We can check whether a given first order differential equation is homogeneous or not by using the command odeadvisor after loading DEtools package.

This collection of line segment is known as the direction fields of the differential equations. In Maple you can use the DEplot command, but make sure to load the DEtools package. DEplot(deqns, vars, xrange, options) deqns - list or set of first order ordinary differential equations, or a single differential equation of any order vars - dependent variable, or list or set of dependent variables xrange - range of the independent variable Example 7.11 Let see how to graph the direction fields associated with the equation, \\[y&#39; = y(4 − y), y(0) = 1\\] [&gt; restart; [&gt; with(DEtools): [&gt; ODE3:=diff(y(t),t)=y(t)*(4-y(t)); [&gt; dsolve({ODE3,y(0)=1},y(t)); [&gt; DEplot(ODE3,y(t),t=-1..1,y=-1..5); Let’s add a solution curve to this plot. To do this, we must specify an initial condition. Let’s try \\(y(0)=1\\).

In the case of a floating-point number, an optional third argument determines the total number of digits of precision in the answer (the default being Digits). The binary number is returned as a base 10 number consisting of the digits 1 and 0 only. [&gt; convert(123,binary); [&gt; convert(-5,binary); [&gt; convert(0.375,binary); [&gt; convert(0.375,binary,2); [&gt; convert(54.6875,binary); [&gt; convert(12.34,binary); [&gt; convert(1964,binary); 8.10.2 convert(n,decimal,binary) This command can be used to convert a decimal number into a binary number. Also we can write 2 as a third argument instead of binary. [&gt; convert(101,decimal,binary); [&gt; convert(101,decimal,2); [&gt; convert(11110101100,decimal,binary); [&gt; convert(11111111, decimal,2); [&gt; convert(0.1101,decimal,2); [&gt; convert (1101.0111,decimal,2); [&gt; convert (10101011101.01111,decimal,2); 8.11 Exercise 3 Exercise 8.11 Express the following numbers in binary number system 57 126 201 487956 7879564789 987.14562 -456 8795.2356 -1213.78 Exercise 8.12 Express the following binary numbers in the decimal system \\((1010101010)_2\\) \\((1010101)_2\\) \\((1100110)_2\\) \\((1010101010)_2\\) \\((101010.1010)_2\\) \\((1111.1111)_2\\) \\((11001100.0011)_2\\) "],["basic-programming.html", "Lesson 9 Basic Programming 9.1 Simple Procedures 9.2 Procedures with local variables 9.3 Exercise 01 9.4 Conditional Statements 9.5 Repetition statement 9.6 Exercise 2", " Lesson 9 Basic Programming 9.1 Simple Procedures A Maple procedure (a type of program) is a group of statements that are processed together. The easiest way to create a Maple procedure is to enclose a sequence of commands, which can be used to perform a computation interactively, between the proc(...) and end proc statements. A Maple procedure has the following syntax: proc(seqvar) statseq ; end; where seqvar is a sequence of symbols of inputs separated by commas, and statseq is a sequence of statements separated by semicolons. The following procedure generates the string “Hello World”. Enter this procedure in a Maple session by entering its definition on one line. If no input is required to run a procedure, that is, no formal parameters are required; enter empty parentheses in the heading of the procedure definition and in procedure calls. 9.1.1 Procedures with no inputs (parameters) [&gt; hello:= proc() &quot;Hello , This is my first Programm &quot; ;end proc; [&gt; hello ( ) ; &gt; Remark: You can also enter a procedure or any Maple statement on multiple lines. To move the cursor to the next line as you are entering a multi line statement, hold the Shift key and press Enter at the end of each line. [&gt; hello:=proc() &quot;Hello , This is my first Programm ; end proc; [&gt; hello(); You can also use the return command to return the evaluated statement or a value [&gt; hello:=proc() return &quot;Hello , This is my first Programm ; end proc; [&gt; hello(); 9.1.2 Procedures with inputs (parameters) Procedures can also accept arguments. Consider following exmpale Example 9.1 Compute the half of the value of a given value. [&gt; half:=proc(x) evlaf(x/2); end proc; [&gt; half(5); This procedure requires one input, \\(x\\). The procedure computes the approximation of the value of \\(x\\) divided by \\(2\\). When a return statement is not specified, a Maple procedure returns the result of the last statement that was run. [&gt; half(7)+half(8); Example 9.2 Compute the average of two given numbers [&gt; Average:=proc(x,y) (x+y) / 2 end proc; [&gt; Average(7,12) ; [&gt; evalf(%) ; [&gt; evalf(Average(254,789)); Example 9.3 Compute the area of a cylinder [&gt; area_of_cylinder:=proc(r,h) 2*Pi*r*h+2*Pi*r^2; end proc ; [&gt; area_of_cylinder(4,15); [&gt; evalf(%) Example 9.4 Solve the quadric equations when the coefficients are given. [&gt; s:=proc(a,b,c) solve(a*x^2+b*x+c,x) end proc; [&gt; s(1,-4,3); # Roots of x^2-4x+3=0 [&gt; s(1,0,1); # Roots of x^2+1=0 Example 9.5 The follovving procedure will solve \\(x^n-1=0\\) for specific value of \\(n\\). [&gt; solution:=proc (n) solve(x^n—1,x); end proc; [&gt; solution(1); [&gt; solution(2); [&gt; solution(4); [&gt; seq(solution(i),i=1..5); 9.2 Procedures with local variables Example 9.6 Finding the volume of a right rectangular pyramid. [&gt; Volume_of_Right_rectangular_pyramid:=proc(l,w,h) local V; V:=evalf((l*w*h)/3) ; end; [&gt; Volume_of_Right_rectangular_pyramid(21,8,7); Example 9.7 The following procedure definition contains two input parameters for the length of sides of a right triangle. It calculates the theta value in degree form. [&gt; GetAng1e:= proc(opposite,hypotenuse) local theta; theta:=arcsin(opposite/hypotenuse); evalf(180/Pi*theta) ; end proc ; [&gt; GetAng1e(4,5); The local variables can be thought as “scratch pad variables”, or “temporary variable?’ Local variables are used to hold temporary results that might come up while we are trying to compute our main result in the procedure. As we will see. the local variables only”live” inside the procedure call. They do not exist outside the procedure, and they do not survive from one procedure call to the next (this is why they get their name “local”). The global variable is just that. it is global to the whole Maple worksheet. As we will see, global variables inside procedure bodies are really the same as the variables we use in commands at our worksheet prompts. . [&gt; plus:proc(x,y) local a,b; global c; a:=x-y; b:=x*y; c:=x^y; end; [&gt; plus(2,5); [&gt; a; [&gt; b; [&gt; c; The following example contains three local variables. You should define all the variable that you used as the local within your procedure. Example 9.8 This example shows how calculate the average value for a given list. [&gt; avg1:= proc(L) local i,N,S; # Local variables. N := nops(L); # How many numbers we are averaging. S := add(L[i],i=1..N); # Add up the nurnbers in the list. S/N; # This is the return value . end ; [&gt; avg([2,3,4,5,6,7]); [&gt; evalf(%); 9.3 Exercise 01 Exercise 9.1 Write Maple procedures to calculate the sum of the squares of two numbers you entered. Hence calculate the sum of the squares of 629 and 1 1 1 1. Exercise 9.2 Use Maple to show that the sum of first n positive integers is given by,\\(\\frac{n(n+l)}{2}\\) Exercise 9.3 Write a maple procedure to check whether a product of two given integers is prime or not. Verify your procedure. Exercise 9.4 Find the area of a triangle with 3 sides given. \\((\\text{Area} =\\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}\\) where \\(s=\\frac{a+b+c}{2}\\) and \\(a, b, c\\) are the length of the each side of triangle). Find the area of the triangle with each side of \\(5,7,9\\). Exercise 9.5 Write a procedure to convert two binary numbers into decimal and return their summation. (try out your procedure with \\(110010, 11001100\\)) 9.4 Conditional Statements Suppose that you want a sequence of commands to be carried out if and only if a certain condition is satisfied. This often happens when you are writing the definition ofa procedure. You can achieve the desired effect with an if... then construction. but first you need to know how you can express conditions in Maple. then [&gt; if conditional_statement1 then statemnet_sequnce1 elif conditional_statement2 then statemnet_sequnce2 elif conditional_statement3 then statemnet_sequnce3 ... else statemnet_sequnceN end if; The elif conditional expression then construct can appear zero, one, or many times. The else construct can be excluded. The conditional expression (expr) in the if clause is evaluated. The conditional expression can be any Boolean expression, which evaluates to true, false, or FAIL, formed by using: relational operators: &lt; (less than), &lt;= (less than or equal), = (equal), and &lt;&gt; (not equal) logical operators: and, or, and not logical names: true, false, and FAIL If the result of the if clause is the Boolean value true, Maple executes the statement sequence in the then clause. If the result of the if clause is the Boolean value false or FAIL, Maple executes the statement sequence in the else clause (if there is one). [&gt; x:=-2; [&gt; if x&lt;0 then 0 else 1 end if; You can omit the else clause if you do not want to specify an action if the condition is false. [&gt; if x&gt;0 then x:=x-1; end if; 9.4.1 Nested Selection Statements A selection statement can be nested that is, the statement sequence in the then clause or else clause can be any statement (or sequence of statements); including an if statement. [&gt; if x&gt;0 then print(&quot;Positive&quot;) else if x=0 then print(&quot;Zero&quot;) else print(&quot;Negative&quot;) end if end if; General Forms of the if Statement For more complicated scenarios, use one of the following two forms of the if statement. if expr1 then statseq1 elif expr2 then statseq2 end if if expr1 then statseq1 elif expr2 then statseq2 else statseq3 end if The elif expr then statseq construct can appear more than once. The following example implements the mathematical sign function by using an elif clause. [&gt; x:=2; [&gt; if x&lt;0 then -1 elif x=0 then 0 else 1 end if; We can also include those if—else commnands into a maple procedure. Example 9.9 The following procedure is to display the grade obtained by the mark. [&gt; Grade:=proc (M) if M&gt;=50 then &quot;pass&quot; else &quot;fail&quot; end if; end proc; [&gt; Grade(49); [&gt; Grade(51); More than one “if” Example 9.10 . [&gt; Grade:=proc(M) if M&gt;=75 then A elif M&gt;=50 then B elif M&gt;35 then C else D end if; end proc; [&gt; Grade(75); [&gt; Grade(42); [&gt; Grade(60); You can use fi intstead of end if Example 9.11 This procedure can be used to check whether a given number is a perfect or not. Definition 9.1 A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive proper divisors. [&gt; with (numtheory): [&gt; is_perfect :=proc(n) if sigma(n)=2*n then return true ; else return false; end if; end proc; [&gt; is_perfect(6); 9.4.2 The `if Operator The operator form ‘if’ requires three arguments and it returns the evaluation of the second or third argument, depending on the truth value of the first. `if` (conditional expr, true expr, false expr) The first argument must evaluate to true, false, or FAIL. If the first argument evaluates to true, the second argument is evaluated and returned. If the first arguments evaluates to false or FAIL, the third argument is evaluated and returned. When the operator form is used, the name of this function must be enclosed in right single quotes (```) because if is a Maple reserved word. [&gt; b:=4; [&gt; `if` (b&gt;5,10,11); This ’if operator statement is equivalent to the following if statement. if b&gt;5 then 10 else 11 end if; 9.5 Repetition statement A loop (repetition statement) executes a section of code multiple times. Maple has two general forms of repetition, statements that you can use to perform looping in procedures. There are several ways to get Maple to perform what is called a “loop”. 9.5.1 For Loops There are two types of for loops. - Until a counter variable value exceeds a limit (for/from loop) - For each operand of an expression (for/in loop) 9.5.1.1 For/from loop The for/from loop statement repeats a statement sequence until a counter variable value exceeds a limit. Syntax [&gt; for counter from intial by increment to final do statement sequence end do; Example 9.12 This example shows how we can display numbers using a for loop. If you do want it to print something about what is going on, you can ask for it with a print cornrnand. [&gt; for i from 1 to 5 do x:=i; print(x); end do: &gt; You can use od instead of end do. If you use end do; instead of end do: you will get like a out put as follows. [&gt; for i from 1 to 5 do x:=i; print(x); end do; Example 9.13 The following procedure can be used to return a factorial value of a given value. [&gt; fact:=proc(n) local i, p; p:=1; for i from 1 to n do p:=p*i; end do ; end proc; [&gt; fact(5); Example 9.14 The following loop returns the square root of the integers 1 to 5 (inclusive). When the value of the counter variable n is strictly greater than 5, Maple exits the loop. [&gt; for n from 1 to 5 do evalf(sqrt(n)) ; end do; [&gt; n; The previous loop is equivalent to the following for/from statement. [&gt; for n from 1 by 1 to 5 do evalf(sqrt(n)); end do; The by value can be negative. The loop repeats until the value of the counter variable is strictly value. [&gt; for n from 10 by -1 to 3 do if isprime(n) then print(n) end if; end do; [&gt; n; 9.5.1.2 For/in loop for/in loop statement repeats a statement sequence for each component (operand) of an expression, for example, thc elements of a list. Syntax [&gt; for variable in expression do statemnent sequence end do; Example 9.15 The following loop returns a floating-point approximation to the sin function at the angles (measured in degree) in the list L [&gt; L:=[23.4, 87.2, 43.0,99.7]; [&gt; for i in L do evalf(sin(i*Pi/180)); end do; 9.5.2 While Loop The while loop repeats a statement sequence until a boolean expression does not hold. (ie. A while loops repeats until its boolean expression conditional expression evaluates to false or FAIL) Syntax [&gt; while conditional_expression do statment_sequnce end do; Example 9.16 .

Let’s look at them through examples. You can use maple help. &gt; ? matrix &gt; restart; &gt; with(linalg): &gt; M1 :=matrix (3, 3, [1,-2,-3,2,-2,2,3,-3,3]); &gt; M2:= matrix(3,4,[1,1/2,-1/3,1/4,2,1/2,-3/4,5/4,3,3/5,3/7,3/8]); [&gt; A:= matrix(3,3,[[1,-3,-2],[2,-3,5],[-4,2,6]]); [&gt; B:=matrix([[1,-3,-2],[2,-3,5],[-4,2,6]]); [&gt; Matrix (2,2,fill=a); [&gt; Matrix (2,2,symbol=a); [&gt; f:=i-&gt;x*i-1; [&gt; M:=Matrix(2,f); [&gt; g:=(i,j)-&gt;x*(i+j—l); [&gt; M1:=Matrix(3,g); To define a diagonal matrix.

A solution to a system consists of one or more sets of specific values that our common solutions to each of the individual equations.

The matrices and vectors must have the same number of rows. 11.2 Solving Linear Systems There are three types of systems of linear equations, and three types of solutions. An independent system has exactly one solution. An inconsistent system has no solution. A dependent system has infinitely many solutions. — Type of Linear System Independent Systems Inconsistent Systems No of Solution Exactly one solution No solution Infinitely many solutions Example 1 \\[\\begin{aligned}x - 3y &amp;=-3\\\\2x + y &amp;= 8\\end{aligned}\\] \\[\\begin{aligned}x - 3y &amp;= - 3\\\\x -y &amp;=3\\end{aligned}\\] \\[\\begin{aligned}x - 3y &amp;= - 3\\\\2x + 6y &amp;= -6 \\end{aligned}\\] Example 2 \\[\\begin{aligned}x+y+z&amp;=2\\\\ 6x-4y+5z&amp;=1\\\\ 5x+2y+2z&amp;=3\\end{aligned}\\] \\[\\begin{aligned}x-3y+z&amp;=4\\\\-y-4z&amp;=7\\\\2y+8z&amp;=24 \\end{aligned}\\] \\[\\begin{aligned}2x+y-3z&amp;=0\\\\ 4x+2y-6z&amp;=0\\\\ x-y+z&amp;=0\\end{aligned}\\] Let’s try to solve linear system. Independent Systems: \\[ \\begin{array}{ccccccc} 2x &amp;+&amp; 5y &amp;-&amp; 4z &amp;=&amp; 9 \\\\ 3x &amp;+&amp; 5y &amp;+&amp; 2z &amp;=&amp; 12 \\\\ 4x &amp;-&amp; y &amp;+&amp; 5z &amp;=&amp; -3 \\end{array} \\] \\[ \\underbrace{\\begin{bmatrix} 2 &amp; 5 &amp; -4 \\\\ 3 &amp; 5 &amp; 2 \\\\ 4 &amp; -1 &amp; 5 \\end{bmatrix}}_A \\underbrace{\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y\\\\z \\end{bmatrix}}_X = \\underbrace{\\begin{bmatrix} 9\\\\12\\\\-3 \\end{bmatrix}}_B \\] 11.2.1 Method I A linear system is a collection of first degree equations. A solution to a system consists of one or more set of specific values that our common solution to each of the individual equations. Here is a simple example which we can solve quite easily using the solve command. [&gt; sys:={2*x+5*y-4*z=9,3*x+5*y+2*z=12,4*x-y+5*z=-3}; [&gt; solve(sys,{x,y,z}); Output: Maple will automatically use fractions, however you can force decimal answers using the evalf command. [&gt; evalf(%); Output: 11.2.2 Method II We can also convert the above system of equations to a matrix system. [&gt; A:=genmatrix(sys,[x,y,z],b); [&gt; evalm(b); Output: In this case , \\(A\\) is the coefficient matrix, and \\(b\\) is vector representing the constant values. The command evalm(b) evaluated \\(b\\) as a matrix (a vector is a \\(n \\times 1\\) matrix). In other words, this command simply writes out what the vector \\(b\\) looks like. [&gt; linsolve(A,b); Output: 11.2.3 Method III Another way to solve a matrix equation \\(Ax = b\\) is to left multiply both sides by the inverse matrix \\(A^{-1}\\), if it exists, to get the solution \\(x = A^{-1}b\\). [&gt; inverse(A); [&gt; evalm(inverse(A)&amp;*b); Output: The evalm command forces a matrix computation and express the result. Dependent Systems: Some systems are dependent which means there are an infinite number of solutions. The form of these solutions will entail the use of parameters. Let’s look an example using two different methods; solve and linsolve. Example 11.1 \\[ \\begin{array}{ccccccccc} x &amp;-&amp; 2y&amp;+&amp; z &amp;=&amp; &amp;3\\\\ x &amp;+&amp; y &amp;-&amp; 2z&amp;=&amp;-&amp;4\\\\ 2x&amp;-&amp; y &amp;-&amp; z &amp;=&amp;-&amp;1 \\end{array} \\] [&gt; restart; [&gt; with(linalg): [&gt; sys:={x-2*y+z=3,x+y-2*z=-4,2*x-y-z=-1}; [&gt; solve(sys,{x,y,z}); output: [&gt; A:=genmatrix(sys,[x,y,z],b); [&gt; evalm(b); [&gt; linsolve(A,b); output: In both cases, the solution contains a parameter. The solve command express it in terms actual variable used,and the linsolve command use the funny t character to distinguish it from a variable you might have defined yourself. Inconsistent System An Inconsistent system has no solution. Maple generally, refers to answer questions which have no answer. Example 11.2 \\[ \\begin{array}{ccccccccc} x &amp;+&amp; y &amp;-&amp; 3z &amp;= 10\\\\ x &amp;+&amp; y &amp;-&amp; z &amp;= 1\\\\ x &amp;+&amp; y &amp;+&amp; z &amp;= 8 \\end{array} \\] Let’s try to solve this system. [&gt; restart; [&gt; with(linalg): [&gt; sys:={x+y-3*z=10,x+y-z=1,x+y+z=8}; [&gt; solve(sys,{x,y,z}); Output: This method does not work. It does not return anything. Let’s try linsolve method. [&gt; A:=genmatrix(sys,[x,y,z],b); [&gt; linsolve(A,b); Output: This method also does not works. [&gt; evalm(inverse(A)&amp;*b); Output: 11.2.3.1 Automatic Reduction [&gt; sys:={3*x+5*y+2*z=12,2*x+5*y-4*z=9,4*x-y+5*z=-3}; [&gt; evalm(b); [&gt; C:=augment(A,b); Output: 11.2.4 Method IV An even faster method is simplifying let maple to do all the work for us. The gausselim command will perform all of the steps of Gaussian eliminations and reduce an augmented matrix to row echelon form. [&gt; sys:={3*x+5*y-2*z=12,2*x+5*y-4*z=9,4*x-y+5*z=-3}; [&gt; A:=genmatrix(sys,[x,y,z],b); [&gt; evalm(b); [&gt; C:=augment(A,b); [&gt; gausselim(C); 11.2.5 Method V The command gaussjord does the same thing. It performs all the steps of Gauss Jordan elimination and reduces and reduces an augmented matrix into reduced row echelon form.

Each boat requires the services of three departments, as listed in the table.

The number of elements is inferred from the number of expressions. &lt;a,b,c&gt; To create a row vector, specify a vertical-bar-delimited (|) sequence, &lt;a | b | c&gt;. The number of elements is inferred from the number of expressions. &lt;a|b|c&gt; 13.2 Basis Definition 13.1 A basis of \\(V\\) is a list of vectors in \\(V\\) that is linearly independent and, spans \\(V\\). The \\(\\text{Basis}(V)\\) function returns a list or set of Vectors that forms a basis for the vector space spanned by the original Vectors in terms of the original Vectors. A basis for the \\(0\\)-dimensional space is an empty list or set. If \\(V\\) is a list of Vectors, the \\(\\text{Basis}(V)\\) function returns a list of Vectors. If \\(V\\) is a single Vector or a set of Vectors, a set of Vectors is returned. [&gt; with(Student[LinearAlgebra]): [&gt; vl := &lt;1|0|0&gt;; [&gt; v2 := &lt;0|1|0&gt;; [&gt; v3 := &lt;0|0|1&gt;; [&gt; v4 := &lt;0|1|1&gt;; [&gt; v5 := &lt;1|1|1&gt;; [&gt; v6 := &lt;4|2|0&gt;; [&gt; v7 := &lt;3|0|-1&gt;; [&gt; Basis([vl,v2,v2]); Example 13.1 Determine a basis for the space spanned by the set of vectors {(2,13,-15),(7,-2,13),(5,-4,9)}. Express the vector (25, -4, 9) with respect to this basis. [&gt; v1:= &lt;2,13,-15&gt;; [&gt; v2:= &lt;7,-2,13&gt;; [&gt; v3:= &lt;5,-4,9&gt;; [&gt; basis:=Matrix(Basis([v1,v2,v3])); [&gt; LinearSolve(basis,&lt;25,-4,9&gt;); Example 13.2 Determine a basis for the space spanned by the set of vectors {(1,2,2,-1),(1,3,1,1),(1,5,-1,5),(1,1,4,-1),(2,7,0,2)}.

The Vectors are returned in canonical form with leading entries 1. The row space(column space) of a zero Matrix is the empty list. [&gt; A:=&lt;&lt;1,2,0&gt;|&lt;0,2,6&gt;|&lt;0,0,4&gt;|&lt;0,0,0&gt;&gt;; [&gt; RowSpace(A); [&gt; ColumnSpace(A); [&gt; RowSpace(&lt;&lt;0,0&gt;|&lt;0,0&gt;&gt;); [&gt; B:=&lt;&lt;x,0&gt;|&lt;y,1&gt;&gt;; [&gt; ColumnSpace(B); 13.3 Dimension Dimension(A) function. where \\(A\\) is a Vector, returns a non-negative integer that represents the number of elements in A. If \\(A\\) is a Matrix. two non-negative integers representing the row dimension and the column dimension of A. respectively. are returned. The RowDimension(A) function, where \\(A\\) is a Matrix, returns a non-negative integer that represents the number of rows in \\(A\\). The ColumnDimension function. where \\(A\\) is a Matrix, returns a non-negative integer that represents the number of columns in \\(A\\). [&gt; v:=&lt;x,y,z,w&gt;; [&gt; Dimension(v); [&gt; A:=IdentityMatrix(3,5); [&gt; row_dim:=RowDimension(A); [&gt; col_dim:=ColumnDimension(A); [&gt; m,n:=Dimension(A); 13.4 Rank If \\(A\\) does not have a floating-point data type, then the Rank(A) function computes the rank of \\(A\\) by performing Gaussian elimination on the rows of \\(A\\). The rank of Matrix \\(A\\) is the number of non-zero rows in the resulting Matrix. [&gt; restart; [&gt; with (LinearAlgebra) : [&gt; A := ScalarMatrix(n,3); [&gt; Rank(A); [&gt; B:=&lt;&lt;-7,1,2&gt;|&lt;2,1,-1&gt;|&lt;3,0,-1&gt;|&lt;2,7,-3&gt;&gt;; [&gt; Rank(B); [&gt; nops(RowSpace(B)); 13.5 Vector Fields A vector field is be a function where the domain is \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) and the range is \\(n\\)-dimensional vectors. Here we discuss some important mathematical concepts on a vector field. 13.6 Directional derivative(f,var=pts,dir) The DirectionalDerivative(f,var=pts,dir) command returns the directional derivative of \\(f\\), evaluated at \\(pt\\) if it is specified in the direction given by \\(dir\\) that is the product of the Jacobian matrix of the function \\(f\\), evaluated at \\(pt\\) if is specified, and the normalized direction sector \\(dir\\). [&gt; with(Student[MultivariateCalculus]); [&gt; DirectionalDerivative(3+x*y+2*x*y^2,[x,y]=[-1,3],[2,1]); I will add more details and example on this topic later. 13.7 \\(\\text{Curl}(A), \\text{Divergence}(A)\\) and \\(\\text{Gradient}(A)\\) [&gt; with(Student[VectorCalculus]); 13.7.1 Cartesian system Definition 13.2 The gradient of a scalar-valued function \\(f(x, y, z)\\) is the vector field: \\[ \\text{grad}(f)=\\nabla f = \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} \\right) \\] Note that the input, \\(f\\), for the gradient is a scalar-valued function, while the output, \\(\\nabla f\\), is a vector-valued function. The divergence of a vector field \\(\\mathbf{F}(x, y, z)=(F_1,F_2,F_3)=F_1 i +F_2 j+ F_3 k\\) is the scalar-valued function: \\[ \\text{div} \\, \\mathbf{F} = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{F} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial F_3}{\\partial z} \\right) \\] Note that the input, \\(\\mathbf{F}\\), for the divergence is a vector-valued function, while the output, \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{F}\\), is a scalar-valued function. The curl of a vector field \\(\\mathbf{F}(x, y, z)\\) is the vector field: \\[ \\begin{align} \\text{curl } \\mathbf{F} &amp;= \\left( \\frac{\\partial F_3}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial z}, \\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial F_3}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial y} \\right)\\\\ &amp;= \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F} \\end{align} \\] Note that the input, \\(\\mathbf{F}\\), for the curl is a vector-valued function, and the output, \\(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F}\\), is again a vector-valued function.

Starting with polar coordinates, we can follow this same process to create a new three-dimensional coordinate system, called the cylindrical coordinate system. In this way, cylindrical coordinates provide a natural extension of polar coordinates to three dimensions. Definition 13.3 In the cylindrical coordinate system, a point in space is represented by the ordered triple \\((r,\\theta,z)\\), where: \\((r,\\theta)\\) are the polar coordinates of the point’s projection in the \\(xy\\)-plane. \\(z\\) is the usual \\(z\\)-coordinate in the Cartesian coordinate system. The right triangle lies in the \\(xy\\)-plane. The length of the hypotenuse is \\(r\\) and \\(\\theta\\) is the measure of the angle formed by the positive \\(x\\)-axis and the hypotenuse. The \\(z\\)-coordinate describes the location of the point above or below the \\(xy\\)-plane.} [&gt; SetCoordinates(&#39;cylindrical&#39;); [&gt; Curl(); [&gt; Divergence(); [&gt; Gradient(); 13.7.3 Spherical system In the Cartesian coordinate system, the location of a point in space is described using an ordered triple in which each coordinate represents a distance. In the cylindrical coordinate system, the location of a point in space is described using two distances (\\(r\\) and \\(z\\)) and an angle measure (\\(\\theta\\)). In the spherical coordinate system, we again use an ordered triple to describe the location of a point in space. In this case, the triple describes one distance and two angles. Spherical coordinates make it simple to describe a sphere, just as cylindrical coordinates make it easy to describe a cylinder. Grid lines for spherical coordinates are based on angle measures, like those for polar coordinates. Definition 13.4 (Spherical Coordinate System) In the spherical coordinate system, a point \\(P\\) in space is represented by the ordered triple \\((\\rho, \\theta, \\phi)\\) where \\(\\rho\\) is the distance between \\(P\\) and the origin (\\(\\rho \\neq 0\\)); \\(\\theta\\) is the same angle used to describe the location in cylindrical coordinates; \\(\\phi\\) is the angle formed by the positive \\(z\\)-axis and line segment \\(\\overline{OP}\\), where \\(O\\) is the origin and \\(0 \\leq \\phi \\leq \\pi\\).
