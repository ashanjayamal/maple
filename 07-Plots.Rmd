# Plots

**Maple Packages**

In Maple we can use various packages for special applications. In order to use a package, you have to load the package first using the `with` command.

**Example**\
`> with(student):`\
`> with(linalg):`

So, when you are dealing with plots, you have to load the package `plot`.
```
 > with(plots):
```


##  Basic Graphs
Using the plot command you can graph a function. You have to give the range of values for $x$ otherwise Maple will use the default range.

## Multiple Graphs
If you want to compare plots, you can have two or more plot windows open at the same time or you can plot more than one curve on the same set of axes. The plot command offers options which control the number of points at which the function is plotted, the number of 
tick marks on the axes and the placing of titles on the graph. Read the help page on plot to find out about these options.
