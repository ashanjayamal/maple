# System of Linear Equations and Matrices 
A linear system is a collection of first degree equations. A solution to a system consists of one or more sets of specific values that our common solutions to each of the individual equations. Here is a simple example which we can solve quite easily using the `solve` command.


## Augment of a matrix


```
[> with(linalg):
[> A:=matrix([[1,2],[2,3]]);
```

*Output*:

```
[> B:=matrix([[3,4,5],[6,7,8]]);
```

*Output*:

```
augment(A,B);
```

*Output*:

![](figures/Lesson 5/fig3.png){width=60%}



The function augment joins two or more matrices  together horizontally.
The matrices and vectors must have the same number of rows. 

##  Solving Linear Systems

There are three types of systems of linear equations, and three types of solutions.

- An **independent system** has exactly one solution.
- An **inconsistent system** has no solution.
- A **dependent system** has infinitely many solutions. 

---|Type of Linear\ System |Independent\ Systems | Inconsistent\ Systems |Dependent\ Systems|
|:-------------|:-------------------:|:------------:|:---------------:|
|No of Solution|Exactly one solution |No solution |Infinitely many solutions|
|Example 1|\[\begin{aligned}x - 3y &=-3\\2x + y &= 8\end{aligned}\]|\[\begin{aligned}x - 3y &= - 3\\x -y &=3\end{aligned}\]|\[\begin{aligned}x - 3y &= - 3\\2x + 6y &= -6 \end{aligned}\]|

|Example 2|\[\begin{aligned}x+y+z&=2\\
6x-4y+5z&=1\\
5x+2y+2z&=3\end{aligned}\]|\[\begin{aligned}x-3y+z&=4\\-y-4z&=7\\2y+8z&=24 \end{aligned}\]|\[\begin{aligned}2x+y-3z&=0\\
4x+2y-6z&=0\\
x-y+z&=0\end{aligned}\]|

Let's try to solve linear system.

**Independent Systems**:









\[ \begin{array}{ccccccc} 
2x &+& 5y &-& 4z &=& 9 \\
3x &+& 5y &+& 2z &=& 12 \\
4x &-& y  &+& 5z &=& -3 
\end{array} \]



\[
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 5 & -4 \\
3 & 5 & 2   \\
4 & -1 & 5  
\end{bmatrix}}_A
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
x \\ y\\z
\end{bmatrix}}_X
=
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
9\\12\\-3
\end{bmatrix}}_B
\]



### Method I
A linear system is a collection of first degree equations.
A solution to a system consists of one or more set of specific values that our common solution to each of the individual equations.
Here is a simple example which we can solve quite easily using the solve command.


```
[> sys:={2*x+5*y-4*z=9,3*x+5*y+2*z=12,4*x-y+5*z=-3};
[> solve(sys,{x,y,z});
```

*Output*:

  ![](figures/Lesson 5/fig4.png)


Maple will automatically use fractions, however you can force decimal answers using the ***evalf*** command.

```
[> evalf(%);
```

*Output*:

  ![](figures/Lesson 5/fig5.png)


### Method II
We can also convert the above system of equations to a matrix system.

```
[> A:=genmatrix(sys,[x,y,z],b);
[> evalm(b);
```

*Output*:

  ![](figures/Lesson 5/fig6.png){width=70%}


In this case , 

- $A$ is the coefficient matrix, and 
- $b$ is vector representing the constant values.


The command  `evalm(b)` evaluated $b$ as a matrix (a vector is a $n \times 1$ matrix).
In other words, this command simply writes out what the vector $b$ looks like.


```
[> linsolve(A,b);
```


*Output*:

  ![](figures/Lesson 5/fig7.png){width=70%}


### Method III

Another way to solve a matrix equation \(Ax = b\) is to left multiply both sides by the inverse matrix \(A^{-1}\), if it exists, to get the solution \(x = A^{-1}b\).

```
[>  inverse(A);
[> evalm(inverse(A)&*b);
```


*Output*:

![](figures/Lesson 5/fig8.png)


The `evalm` command forces a matrix computation and express the result.

**Dependent Systems**:

Some systems are dependent which means there are an infinite number of solutions. The form of these solutions will entail the use of parameters. 
Letâ€™s look an example using two different methods; `solve` and `linsolve`.

```{example}
\[
\begin{array}{ccccccccc}
x &-& 2y&+& z &=& &3\\
x &+& y &-& 2z&=&-&4\\
2x&-& y &-& z &=&-&1  
\end{array}
\]
```

```
[> restart;
[> with(linalg):
[> sys:={x-2*y+z=3,x+y-2*z=-4,2*x-y-z=-1};
[> solve(sys,{x,y,z});
```


*output*: 
  ![](figures/Lesson 5/fig9.png)


```
[> A:=genmatrix(sys,[x,y,z],b);
[> evalm(b);
[> linsolve(A,b);
```

*output*: 

![](figures/Lesson 5/fig10.png)


In both cases, the solution contains a parameter. 
The `solve` command express it in terms actual variable used,and the `linsolve` command use the funny t character to distinguish it from a variable you might have defined yourself.

---

**Inconsistent System**

An Inconsistent system has no solution. Maple generally, refers to answer questions which have no answer.

```{example}
\[
\begin{array}{ccccccccc}
x &+& y &-& 3z &= 10\\
x &+& y &-&  z &= 1\\
x &+& y &+&  z &= 8  
\end{array}
\]
```

Let's try to solve this system.

```
[> restart;
[> with(linalg):
[> sys:={x+y-3*z=10,x+y-z=1,x+y+z=8};
[> solve(sys,{x,y,z});
```

*Output*:


  ![](figures/Lesson 5/fig11.png)

This method does not work. It does not return anything. 

Let's try `linsolve` method.

```
[> A:=genmatrix(sys,[x,y,z],b);
[> linsolve(A,b);

```
*Output*:

![](figures/Lesson 5/fig12.png)

This method also does not works.

```
[> evalm(inverse(A)&*b);
```

*Output*:

  ![](figures/Lesson 5/fig13.png)



#### Automatic Reduction

```
[> sys:={3*x+5*y+2*z=12,2*x+5*y-4*z=9,4*x-y+5*z=-3};
[> evalm(b);
[> C:=augment(A,b);
```

*Output*:

![](figures/Lesson 5/fig14.png)


### Method IV
An even faster method is simplifying let maple to do all the work for us. The `gausselim` command will perform all of the steps of Gaussian eliminations and reduce an augmented matrix to **row echelon form**.


```
[> sys:={3*x+5*y-2*z=12,2*x+5*y-4*z=9,4*x-y+5*z=-3};
[> A:=genmatrix(sys,[x,y,z],b);
[> evalm(b);
[> C:=augment(A,b);
[> gausselim(C);
```

![](figures/Lesson 5/fig15.png)


### Method V


The command `gaussjord` does the same thing. 
It performs all the steps of Gauss Jordan elimination and reduces and reduces an augmented matrix into reduced row echelon form.

```
[> gaussjord(C);
```

## Exercise

```{exercise}
Solve the following system of equations.
\[
\begin{array}{ccccccc}
x_1  &+& 2x_2 &+& 3x_3 &= 9 \\
2x_1 &-& x_2  &+& x_3  &= 8 \\
3x_1 & &      &-& x_3&= 3
\end{array}
\]
```

```{exercise}
A small manufacturing plant makes three types of inflatable boats: one-person, two-person, and four-person models. 
Each boat requires the services of three departments, as listed in the table. 
The cutting, assembly, and packaging departments have available a maximum of 380, 330, and 120 labor hours per week, respectively.

| Department      | One Person Boat | Two-Person Boat | Four-Person Boat |
|:---------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|:----------------:|
| Cutting         | 0.5 hr          | 1.0 hr          | 1.5 hr           |
| Assembling      | 0.6 hr          | 0.9 hr          | 1.2 hr           |
| Packaging       | 0.2 hr          | 0.3 hr          | 0.5 hr           |


(A) How many boats of each type must be produced each week for the plant to operate at full capacity?
(B) How is the production schedule in part A affected if the packaging department is no longer used?
(C) How is the production schedule in part A affected if the four-person boat is no longer produced?
```
